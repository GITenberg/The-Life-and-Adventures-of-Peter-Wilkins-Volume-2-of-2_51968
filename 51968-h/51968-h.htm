    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next day I
      prepared again of the best of everything for my new guests. I killed three
      fowls, and ordered Pedro (who was as good a cook almost as myself) to get
      them ready for boiling, whilst we took a walk to the lake. Though we went
      out in the clearest part of the morning, I heard no complaint of the
      light. I took the liberty to ask my brother if the light did not offend
      him; for I told him my wife could not bear so much without spectacles.&mdash;"What
      is that spectacle?" says he.&mdash;"Something I made your sister," says I,
      "to prevent the inconvenience of too much light upon her eyes."&mdash;He
      said the light was scarce at all troublesome to him, for he had been in
      much greater, and was used to it; and that the glumms, who travelled much
      abroad, could bear more light than the gawrys, who stayed much at home:
      these stirring but little out unless in large companies, and that of one
      another, and very rarely admitted glumms amongst them before marriage. For
      his own part, he said, he had an office at Crashdoorpt, * which, though he
      executed chiefly by a deputy, obliged him to reside there sometimes for a
      long season together; that being a more luminous country than
      Arndrumnstake, light was become familiar to him; for it was very
      observable that some who had been used to it young, though they might in
      time overcome it, yet at first it was very uneasy.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The country of the Slits.
</pre>
    <p>
      I was upon the tenter whilst he spoke, lest, before he had done, a
      question I had a thousand times thought to have asked my wife, should slip
      out of my head, as it had so often done before, and was what I had for
      years desired to be resolved in; viz., what the meaning of the word slit
      was, when applied to a man. So, on his pausing, I said that his mention of
      Crashdoorpt reminded me of inquiring what crashee meant, when applied to a
      glumm or gawry. "It would be no hard task," he said, "to satisfy me in
      respect of that, as I already understood the nature of the graundee;"
      whereupon he went on thus: "Slitting is the only punishment we use to
      incorrigible criminals: our method is, where any one has committed a very
      heinous offence, or, which is the same thing, has multiplied the acts of
      offence, he has a long string tied round his neck, in the manner of a
      cravat; and then two glumms, one at each end, take it in their hands,
      standing side by side with him; two more standing before him, and two
      behind him; all which in that manner take flight, so that the string keeps
      the criminal in the middle of them: thus they conduct him to Crashdoorpt,
      which lies farther on the other side of Arndrumnstake than this arkoe does
      on this side of it, and is just such an arkoe as ours, but much bigger
      within the rocks. When they come to the covett they alight, where my
      deputy immediately orders the malefactor to be slit, so that he can never
      more return to Normnbdsgrsutt, or indeed by any means get out of that
      arkoe, but must end his days there. The method of slitting is thus: The
      criminal is laid on his back with his graundee open, and after a
      recapitulation of his crimes, and his condemnation, the officer with a
      sharp stone slits the gume * between each of the filuses ** of the
      graundee, so that he can never fly more. But what is still worse to
      new-comers, if they are not very young, is the light of the place, which
      is so strong that it is some years before they can overcome it, if ever
      they do."
    </p>
    <p>
      This discourse gave me a great pleasure; thereupon I repeated the dialogue
      that had passed between me and Youwarkee about my being slit, and how we
      had held an argument a long time, without being able to come at one
      another's meaning. "But pray, brother," says I, "how comes that light
      country to agree so well with you?"&mdash;"Why," says he, "the colambat
      *** of Crashdoorpt is reckoned one of the most honourable employments in
      the state, by reason of the hazard of it, and the person accepting it must
      be young: it was, by my father's interest at court, given to me at nine
      years of age; my friend Rosig has followed my fortune in it ever since,
      being much about my age, and has a post under me there: in short, by being
      obliged to be so much there, and from so tender an age too, I have pretty
      well inured myself to any light."

    <p>
      By this time we had got home again to dinner, which Pedro had set out as
      elegantly as my country could afford, consisting of pickles and preserves,
      as usual, a dish of hard eggs, and boiled fowls with spinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      My guests, as I expected, stared at the fowls, but never offered to touch
      them, or seemed in the least inclined to do so. I was afraid they would be
      cold, and begged them to let me help them. I put a wing on each of their
      plates, and a leg on my own; but perceiving they waited to see how I
      managed it, I stuck in my fork, cut off a slice, dipped it in the salt,
      and put it in my mouth. Just as I did they did, and appeared very well
      pleased with the taste. "I never in my life," says Rosig, "saw a
      crullmott*of this shape before;" and laid hold of a leg (taking it for a
      stick I had thrust in, as he told me afterwards), intending to pull it
      out; but finding it grew there, "Mr. Peter," says he, "you have the
      oddest-shaped crullmotts that ever I saw; pray what part of the woods do
      they grow in?"&mdash;"Grow in?" says I.&mdash;"Aye," says he, "I mean
      whether your crullmott-trees are like ours or not?"&mdash;"Why," says I,
      "these fowls are about my yard and the wood too."&mdash;"What!" says he,
      "is it a running plant like a bott?" **&mdash;"No, no," says I, "a bird
      that I keep tame about my house; and these (showing him the eggs) are the
      eggs of these birds, and the birds grow from them."&mdash;"Pr'ythee," says
      Quangrollart, "never let's inquire what they are till we have dined; for
      my brother Peter will give us nothing we need be afraid of."

</pre>
    <p>
      It growing into the night by that time we rose from table, I set a bowl of
      punch before them, made with my treacle and sour ram's-horn juice, which
      they pulled off plentifully. After some bumpers had gone round, I desired
      my brother to proceed where he left off, in the account of my wife's
      reception with her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When my father," says he, "had recovered himself by some hours' repose,
      the first thing he did was to order my sister Youwarkee to be called; who,
      coming into his presence, he took her from her knees, kissed her, and
      ordered all to depart but myself and Hallycarnie. Then bidding us sit
      down, says he to your wife, 'Daughter, your appearance, whom I have so
      long lamented as dead, has given me the truest cordial I could have
      received, and I hope will add both to my health and years. I have heard
      you suspect my anger for some part of your past conduct (for he had hinted
      so to her sister and me), which you justly enough imagined may be
      censured; but, my dear life, I am this day, what I did not expect any more
      to be, a father of a new-born child; and not of one only, but of many; and
      this day, I say, daughter, shall not be spent in sorrow and excuses, or
      anything to interrupt our mutual felicity; neither will I ever hereafter
      permit you to forget my forgiveness, or attempt to palliate any of your
      proceedings; for know, child, that a benevolence freely bestowed is better
      than twice its value obtained by petition: I, therefore, as in presence of
      the Great Image, your brother and sister, at this instant erase from my
      mind for ever what thoughts I may have had prejudicial to the love I ever
      bore you, as I will have you to do all such as may cloud the unreserved
      complacency you used to appear with before me. And now, Quangrollart,'
      says he, 'let the guard be drawn out before my covett, and let the whole
      country be entertained for seven days; proclaim liberty to all persons
      confined; and let not the least sorrow appear in any face throughout my
      colambat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I retired immediately, and gave the necessary orders for the speedy
      despatch of my father's commands, which indeed were performed to the
      utmost; and nothing for seven days was to be heard through the whole
      district of Arndrumnstake but joy and the name of Youwarkee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father, so soon as he had despatched the above orders, sent for the
      children before him, whom he kissed and blessed, frequently lifting up his
      eyes in gratitude to the Great Image for the unexpected happiness he
      enjoyed on that occasion; and then he ordered Youwarkee to let him know
      what had befallen her in her absence, and where she lived, and with whom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Youwarkee was setting out with some indirect excuses; but my father
      absolutely forbid her, and charged her only to mention plain facts,
      without flourishes. So she began with her swangean, and the accidental
      fall she had, your taking her in after it, and saving her life. She told
      him your continued kindness so wrought upon her, that she found herself
      incapable of disesteeming you, but never showed her affection, till,
      having examined every particular of your life, and finding you a worthy
      man, she could not avoid becoming your wife; and she said the reasons why
      she always declined being seen by her friends in their swangeans, was for
      fear she should be forced from you, though she longed to see us; and that
      at last she was to come by your consent, and that, had it rested there
      only, she might have come much sooner, for that you would often have had
      her show herself to her friends, when you heard them, having strong
      desires yourself to be known to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father, upon hearing this, was so charmed with your tenderness and
      affection to his daughter, that you already rival his own issue in his
      esteem, and he is persuaded he can never do enough for you or your
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The noise of Youwarkee's return, and my father's rejoicing, soon spread
      over all Normnbdsgrsutt; and King Georigetti sent express to my father, to
      command him to attend with your wife and children at Brandleguarp, his
      capital. Thither accordingly we all went with a grand retinue, and stayed
      twenty days. The king took great delight, as well as the ladies of the
      court, to hear Youwarkee and her children talk English, and in being
      informed of you and your way of life; and so fond was Yaccombourse (who,
      though not the king's wife, is instead of one) of my nephew Tommy, that,
      upon my father's return, she took him to herself, and assured my sister he
      should continue near her person till he was qualified for better
      preferment. The king's sister Jahamel would also have taken Patty into her
      service; but she begged to be permitted to attend her mother to
      Arndrumnstake; so Hallycarnie, her sister, who chose to continue with
      Jahamel, was received in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my father's return to Arndrumnstake, he found no less than fifteen
      expresses from several colambs, desiring to rejoice with him on the return
      of his daughter, with particular invitations to him and her to spend some
      time with them. My father, though he hates more pomp than is necessary to
      support dignity, could do no less than severally visit them, with
      Youwarkee, attended by a grand retinue, spending more or less days with
      each; hoping when that was over, he should have some little time to spend
      in retirement with his daughter before her departure, who now began to be
      uneasy for you, who, she said, would suffer the greatest concern in her
      absence: but upon their return from those visits, at about the end of four
      months' progress, they found themselves in as little likelihood of
      retirement as the first day; for the inferior colambs were continually
      posting away, one after another, to perform their respects to my father,
      and all the inferior magistrates of smaller districts sending to know when
      they might be permitted to do the same. Poor Youwarkee, who saw no end of
      it, expressed her concern for you in so lively a manner to my father, that
      finding he could by no means put a stop to the goodwill of the people, and
      not bearing the thoughts of You-warkee's departure till she had now
      received all their compliments, he resolved to keep her with him till the
      next winter set in in these parts, and then to accompany her himself to
      Graundevolet. In the meanwhile, that you might not remain in an uneasy
      suspense what was become of my sister, he ordered me to despatch
      messengers express to inform you of the reasons of her stay; but I told
      him, if he pleased, I would execute that office myself, with my friend
      Rosig, with which he was very well pleased, and enjoined me to assure you
      of his affection, and that he himself was debtor to you for the love and
      kindness you had shown his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus, brother," says Quangrollart, "I hope I have acquitted myself of my
      charge to your satisfaction, and it only now remains that I return you my
      acknowledgments for your hearty welcome to myself and friend; which (with
      concern I speak it) I am afraid I shall not have an opportunity to return
      at Arndrumnstake, the distance being so immensely great and you not having
      the graundee. To-morrow morning my friend and I will set out on our return
      home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quangrollart having done, I told him I could not but blush at the load of
      undeserved praises he had laid on me; but as he had received his notion of
      my merits from a wife too fond to let my character sink for want of her
      support, it would be sufficient if himself could conceive of, and also
      represent me at his return, in no worse a light than other men; and though
      it gave me pain to think of losing my wife so long, yet his account of her
      health and the company he assured me she would return in, would doubly
      compensate my loss; and I begged of him, if it might be with any
      convenience, he would let some messenger come the day before her, to give
      me notice of their approach. As to their departure on the morrow, I told
      them I could by no means think of that, as I had proposed to catch them a
      dinner of fresh fish in the lake, and to show them my boat, and how and
      where I came into this arkoe, believing, by what I had observed, it would
      be no small novelty to them. So, having engaged them one day more, we
      parted for that night to rest.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WAS heartily
      sorry to lose my brother thus quickly, and still more so to find it would
      be a long time yet ere I should see my wife; however, I was resolved to
      behave as cheerfully as possible, and to omit nothing I could do, the few
      remaining hours of Quangrollart's stay with me, to rivet myself thoroughly
      in his esteem, and to dismiss him with a most cordial affection to me and
      the rest of my children here with him. I rose early in the morning, to
      provide a good breakfast for my guests, and considering we should be in
      the air most part of that day, I treated them with a dish of hot
      fish-soup, and set before them on the table a jovial bottle of brandy and
      my silver can; this last piece I chose to show them, as a specimen of the
      richness of my household furniture, and the grandeur of my living,
      concealing most of my other curiosities till Pendlehamby my
      father-in-law's arrival, for I thought it would be imprudent not to have
      somewhat new of this kind to display at his entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a plenteous meal, we set out on our pleasurable expedition, having
      told Pedro what to get for dinner, and that I believed we should not
      return till late.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first took a turn in the wood, but I did not lead them near my tent,
      because I did not choose my wife should hear of that till she came. I then
      showed them my farmyard and poultry, which they were strangely surprised
      at, and wondered to see so many creatures come at my call, and run about
      my legs only upon a whistle, though before there were only two or three to
      be seen. They asked me a hundred questions about the fowl, which I
      answered, and told them these were some such as they had eaten, and called
      crullmotts, the day before. I afterwards carried them to hear the music of
      those plants that I call my cream-cheese, which, as there happened to be a
      small breeze stirring, made their usual melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had diverted ourselves some time in the wood, we went to the
      wet-dock, where I showed them my boat. At first view they wondered what
      use it was for; to satisfy them in that I stepped in, desiring them to
      follow me; but seeing the boat's agitation, they did not choose to venture
      till I assured them they might come with the greatest safety; at length,
      with some persuasion and repeated assurances, I prevailed on them to trust
      themselves with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first rowed to the bridge, where I informed them by what accident I was
      drawn down the stream on the other side of the rock, and after a tedious
      and dangerous passage, discharged safe in the lake through that opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then told them how surprised I had been, just before I knew Youwarkee,
      with the sight of her country-folks, first on the lake, and then taking
      flight from that bridge, and what had been my thoughts, and how great my
      terrors on that occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had viewed the bridge, I took them to my rill (for by this time
      they were reconciled to the boat, and would help me to row it), and showed
      them how I got water. I then landed them to see the method of fishing, for
      which purpose I laid my net in proper order, and fixing it as usual, I
      brought it round out at the rill, and had a very good haul, with which I
      desired them to help me up; for though I could easily have done it myself,
      I had a mind to let them have a hand in the sport, with which they were
      pleased. I perceived, however, the fish were not agreeable to them, for
      when any one came near their hands, they avoided touching it:
      notwithstanding, having got the net on shore, I laid it open; but to see
      how they stared at the fish, creeping backwards, and then at me and the
      net, it made me very merry to myself, though I did not care to show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew up at that draught twenty-two fishes in all, of which a few were
      near an ell long, several about two feet, and some smaller. When they saw
      me take up the large ones in my arms, and tumble them into the boat, they
      both, unrequested, took up the small ones, and put them in likewise; but
      dropping them every time they struck their tails, the fish had commonly
      two or three falls ere they came to the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked them how they liked that sport, and they told me, it was somewhat
      very surprising that I should know just where the fish were, as they could
      see none before I pulled them up, and yet they did not hear me whistle. I
      perceived by this they imagined I could whistle the fish together as well
      as the fowls, and I did not undeceive them, being well enough pleased they
      should think me excellent for something, as I really thought they were on
      account of the graundee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon our return, when I had docked my boat, as there were too many fish to
      carry up by hand to the grotto, I desired them to take a turn upon the
      shore till I fetched my cart for them. I made what haste I could, and
      brought one of my guns with me, which I determined, upon some occasion or
      other, to fire off; for I took it they would be more surprised at the
      explosion of that than at anything they had yet seen. Having loaded my
      fish, and marched backwards, they eyed my cart very much, and wondered
      what made the wheels move about so, taking them for legs it walked upon,
      till I explained the reason of it, and then they desired to draw it, which
      they did with great eagerness, one at a time, the other observing its
      motions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we advanced homewards, there came a large water-fowl, about the size of
      a goose, flying across us. I bid them look at it, which they did. Says my
      brother, "I wish I had it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you have a mind for it," says I, "I'll give it you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you would," says he, "for I never saw anything like it in my
      life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand still then," says I; and stepping two or three yards before them, I
      fired, and down it dropped. I then turned about to observe what impression
      the gun had made on them, and could not help laughing to see them so
      terrified. Rosig, before I could well look about, had got fifty paces from
      me, and my brother was lying behind the cart of fish. I called and asked
      them what was the matter, and desired them to come to me, telling them
      they should receive no harm, and offered my brother the gun to handle; but
      he, thanking me as much as if he had, retired to Rosig.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding they made a serious affair of it (for I saw them whispering
      together), I was under some apprehension for the consequences of my
      frolic. Thinks I, if under this disgust they take flight, refusing to hear
      me, and report that I was about to murder them, or tell any other
      pernicious story to my father of me, I am absolutely undone, and shall
      never see Youwarkee more. So I laid down the gun by the fish, and moving
      slowly towards them, expostulated with them upon their disorder; assuring
      them that though the object before them might surprise them, it was but a
      common instrument in my country, which every boy used to take birds with;
      and protested to them that the gun of itself could do nothing without my
      skill directing it, and that they might be sure I should never employ that
      but to their service. This, and a great deal more, brought us together
      again; and when we came to reasoning coolly, they blamed me for not giving
      them notice. Says I, "There was no room for me to explain the operation of
      the gun to you whilst the bird was on the wing, for it would have been
      gone out of my reach before I could have made you sensible of that, and so
      have escaped me; which, as you desired me to get it you, I was resolved it
      should not do. But for yourselves, surely you could have no diffidence in
      me; that is highly unbecoming of man to man, especially relations; and,
      above all, a relation to whom you have brought the welcomest news upon
      earth, in the love of my dear father, and his reconciliation to my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, by degrees, I brought them to confess that it was only a
      groundless sudden terror which suppressed their reason for a while, but
      that what I said was all very true; and as their serious reflection
      returned, they were satisfied of it. I then stepped for the bird, and
      brought it to them; it was a very fine-feathered creature, and they were
      very much delighted with the beauty of it, and desired it might be laid
      upon the cart and carried home.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way we went afterwards to the grotto, nothing was to be heard from
      them but my praises, and what a great and wise man brother Peter was. "And
      no wonder now, sister Youwarkee," says Quangrollart, "once knowing him,
      could never leave him." It was not my business to gainsay this, but only
      to receive it with so much modesty as might serve to heighten their good
      opinion of me; and I found, upon my wife's return, that Quangrollart had
      painted me in no mean colours to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I once more had the pleasure of entertaining them with the old fare, and
      some of the fresh fish, part boiled and part fried, which last they chose
      before the boiled. We made a very cheerful supper, talking over that day's
      adventures, and of their ensuing journey home, after which we retired to
      rest, mutually pleased. We all arose early the next morning. We took a
      short breakfast, after which Quangrollart and Rosig stuck their chaplets
      with the longest and most beautiful feathers of the bird I shot, thinking
      them a fine ornament. Being now ready for departure, they embraced me and
      the children, and were just taking flight, when it came into my head, that
      as the king's mistress had taken Tommy into her protection, it might
      possibly be a means of ingratiating him in her favour if I sent him the
      flageolet (for I had, in my wife's absence, made two others near as good,
      by copying exactly after it). I therefore desired to know if one of them
      would trouble himself with a small piece of wood I very much wanted to
      convey to my son. Rosig answered, "With all his heart; if it was not very
      long he would put it into his colapet." * So I stepped in, and fetching
      the flageolet, presented it to Rosig. My brother seeing it look oddly,
      with holes in it, desired (after he had asked if it was not a little gun)
      to have the handling of it. It was given him, and he surveyed it very
      attentively. Being inquisitive into the use of it, I told him it was a
      musical instrument, and played several tunes upon it; with which he and
      his companion were in raptures. I doubt not they would have sat a week to
      hear me if I would have gone on; but I desiring the latter to take care of
      its safety, he put it in his colapet, and away they went.

      beard&mdash;Expects his wife&mdash;Reflections on her not coming&mdash;Sees
      a messenger on the rock&mdash;Has notice of Pendlehambys arrival, and

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE news my late
      visitors had brought me set my mind quite at ease; and now having leisure
      to look into my own affairs, with the summer before me, I began to
      consider what preparations I must make against the return of my wife; for,
      according to the report I had heard, I concluded there would be a great
      number of attendants; and as her father would no doubt pique himself upon
      the grandeur of his equipage, if his followers should see nothing in me
      but a plain dirty fellow, I should be contemned, and perhaps my wife,
      through my means, be slighted, or at least lose that respect the report of
      me had in a great measure procured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing therefore that I did, was to look into my chests again,
      wherein I knew there were many of the Portuguese captain's clothes, and
      take out such as would be most suitable to the occasion, and lay them all
      by themselves. I found a blue cloth laced coat, double-breasted, with very
      large gold buttons, and very broad gold button-holes, lined with white
      silk; a pair of black velvet breeches, a large gold-laced hat, and a point
      neckcloth with two or three very good shirts, two pair of red-heeled
      shoes, a pair of white and another of scarlet silk stockings, two
      silver-hilted swords, and several other good things; but upon examination
      of these clothes, and by a letter or two I found in the pockets of some of
      them, directed to Captain Jeremiah Vauclaile, in Thread-needle Street,
      London, I judged these belonged to the English captain, taken by the
      Portuguese ship in Africa. I immediately tried some of them on, and
      thought they became me very well, and laid all those in particular chests,
      to be ready when the time came, and set them into one of my inner rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon examining the contents of another chest, I found a long scarlet cloak
      laced, a case of razors, a pair of scissors, and shaving-glass, a long-wig
      and two bob-wigs, and laid them by; for I was determined, as I might
      possibly have no other opportunity, to make myself appear as considerable
      as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had digested in my mind upon what occasions I would appear in
      either of them, and laid them in proper order, Pedro and I went several
      days to work with the net, and caught abundance of fish, which I salted
      and dried; and we cut a great quantity of long grass to dry, and spread in
      my tent for the lower gentry, and made up a little cock of it; we also cut
      and piled up a large parcel of firewood; and as I had now about thirty of
      the best fish-skins, each of which would cover four chairs, I nailed them
      on for cushions to my chairs, and the rest I sewed together, and made rugs
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had observed that my brother Quangrollart, and Rosig, neither of them
      had beards, and as they were quite smooth-chinned, I conjectured that none
      of their countrymen had any: So, says I, if that is the case, as I have
      now both scissors and razors, I will e'en cut off mine, to be like them. I
      then set up my glass, taking my scissors in hand; but had not quite closed
      them for a snip, when I considered that as I was not of their country, and
      was so different from them in other respects, whether it would not add to
      my dignity to appear with my beard before them. This I debated some time,
      and then determined in favour of my beard; but as this question still ran
      in my mind, and I wavered sometimes this way, sometimes that, I some days
      after prepared again for execution, and took a large slip off; when, says
      I, how can I tell whether I can shave after all? I have not tried yet, and
      if I can't, how much more ridiculous shall I look with stubbed hair here
      and there, than with this comely beard? I must say, I never in my life had
      so long a debate with myself, it holding upwards of two months, varying
      almost every time I thought of it; till one day, dressing myself in a suit
      I had not before tried on, and looking in the glass: It can never be, says
      I, that this grave beard should suit with these fine clothes; no, I will
      have it off, I am resolved. I had no sooner given another good snip, than
      spying the cloak, I had a mind to see how I looked in that. Aye, says I,
      now I see I must either wear this beard or not this cloak. How majestic
      does it look! So sage, so grave, it denotes wisdom and solidity; and if
      they already think well of me, don't let me be fool enough to relinquish
      my claim to that for a gay coat. I had no sooner fixed on this, than I
      took up all the implements to put again into the chest; and the last of
      them being the glass, I would have one more look before I parted with it;
      but my beard made such a horrid, frightful figure, with the three great
      cuts in it, that though it grieved me to think I must part with it just
      when I had come to a resolution to preserve it, I fell to work with my
      scissors, and off it came; and after two or three trials I became very
      expert with my razor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winter coming on, as I knew I must soon have more occasion than ever for a
      stock of provision, from the increase of mouths I expected, I laid in a
      stock for a little army; and when the hurry of that was over, I kept a
      sharp look-out upon the level, in expectation of my company, and had once
      a mind to have brought my tent thither to entertain them in; but it was
      too much trouble for the hands I had, so I dropped the design. I took one
      or other of the children with me every day, and grew more and more uneasy
      at hearing nothing of them; and as uncertain attendance naturally breeds
      thoughtfulness, and the hours in no employ pass so leisurely as in that,
      my mind presaged numberless intervening accidents that might, if not
      entirely prevent their coming, at least postpone it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinks I (and that I fixed for my standard), Youwarkee, I am sure, would
      come if she could; but then, says I, here is a long flight, and to be
      undertaken by an old man too (for I thought my father-in-law much older
      than I afterwards found him), who is now quiet and safe at home; and
      having his daughter with him, is no doubt desirous of continuing so: now,
      what cares he for my uneasiness? He can find one pretence or other, no
      doubt, of drilling on the time till the dark weather is over; and then,
      forsooth, it will be too late to come; and thus shall I be hung up in
      suspense for another year. Or what if my brother, as he called himself,
      for he may be no more a brother of mine than the Pope's, for ought I know,
      came only on a pretence to see how I went on; and not finding, for all his
      sham compliments to me, his sister married to his father's liking, should
      advise him not to send my wife back again; and so all the trouble I have
      had on their account should only prove a standing monument of my foolish
      credulity! Nay, it is not impossible, but as I have already had one
      message to inform me Tommy and Hallycarnie are provided for, as much as to
      say in plain English I shall see them no more, so I may soon have another
      by some sneaking puppy or other, whom I suppose I am to treat for the
      news, to tell me my wife and Patty are provided for too, and I am to thank
      my kind benefactors for taking so great a charge off my hands. Am I? No!
      I'll first set my tent, clothes, chairs, and all other mementoes of my
      stupidity on fire, and by perishing, what's left of us, in the blaze,
      exterminate at once the wretched remains of a deserted family. I hate to
      be made a fool of!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had scarce finished my soliloquy, when I heard a monstrous sort of groan
      or growl in the air, like thunder at a distance. "What's that, Pedro?"
      says I.&mdash;"I never heard the like before, daddy!" says he.&mdash;"Look
      about, boy," says I, "do you see anything?"&mdash;We heard it again.
      "Hark!" says Pedro, "it comes from that end of the lake."&mdash;While we
      were listening to the third sound, says Pedro, "Daddy, yonder is something
      black upon the rock, I did not see just now."&mdash;"Why, it moves," says
      I, "Pedro; here is news, good or bad."&mdash;"Hope the best, daddy," says
      Pedro; "I wish it may be mammy."&mdash;"No," says I, "Pedro, I don't
      expect her before I hear from her."&mdash;"Why, then," says Pedro, "here
      they come; I can plainly discern three of them. If my brother Tommy should
      be there, daddy!"&mdash;"No," says I, "Pedro, no such good news; they tell
      me Tommy's provided for, and that's to suffice for the loss of my child:
      and yet, Pedro, if I could get you settled in England in some good employ,
      I should consent to that: but what Tommy's to be I know not."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the three persons were so near that, seeing us, they called
      out "Peter!" and I making signs for them to alight, they settled just
      before me, and told me that Pendlehamby and Youwarkee would be with me by
      light next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no sooner heard this, but so far was I from firing my tent, that I
      invited them to my grotto, set the best cheer before them, and with
      overhaste to do more than one thing at once, I even left undone what I
      might have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked them who came with my father; and they told me about two hundred
      guards: that knocked me up again, as I had but prepared for about sixty;
      thinks I, My scheme is all untwisted. I then asked them what loud noise it
      was, and if they heard it just before I saw them over the rock. They told
      me they heard only the gripsack they brought with them to distinguish them
      from ordinary messengers; and then one of them showed it me, for I had
      before only taken it for a long staff in his hand: "but," says he, "you
      will hear them much louder to-morrow, and longer, before they come to
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having entertained them to their content, I sent them to rest, not
      choosing to ask any questions; for I avoided anticipating the pleasure of
      hearing all the news from Youwarkee herself. However, the boys and I
      prepared what provisions of fowl and fish we could in the time, to be
      ready cold against they came, and then laid down ourselves.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y mind ran so all
      night upon the settling the formality with which I should receive
      Pendlehamby, that I got little or no rest. In the morning I spread my
      table in as neat a manner as I could, and having dressed myself, Pedro,
      Jemmy, and David, we marched to the plain; myself carrying a chair, and
      each of them a stool. I was dressed in a cinnamon-coloured gold-button
      coat, scarlet waistcoat, velvet breeches, white silk stockings, the
      campaign-wig flowing, a gold-laced hat and feather, point cravat, silver
      sword, and over all my cloak; as for my sons, they had the clothes my wife
      made before she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we heard them coming, I marshalled the children in the order they
      were to sit, and charged them to do as they saw me do, but to keep rather
      a half-pace backwarder than me; and then sitting down in my chair, I
      ordered Pedro to his stool on my right hand, and Jemmy to his on my left,
      and David to the left of Jemmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then sent two of the messengers to meet them, with instructions to let
      Youwarkee know where I waited for them, that they might alight at a small
      distance before they came to me. This she having communicated to her
      father, the order ran through the whole corps immediately when and where
      to alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be impossible for me by words to raise your ideas adequate to the
      grandeur of the appearance this body of men made coming over the rock; but
      as I perceive your curiosity is on the stretch to comprehend it, I shall
      faintly aim at gratifying you.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had heard for some time a sound as of distant rumbling thunder,
      or of a thousand bears in consort, serenading in their hoarsest voices, we
      could just perceive by the clearness of the dawn gilding on the edge of
      the rock, a black stream arise above the summit of it, seemingly about
      forty paces broad; when the noise increasing very much the stream arose
      broader and broader; and then you might perceive rows of poles, with here
      and there a streamer; and as soon as ever the main body appeared above the
      rock, there was such a universal shout as rent the air, and echoing from
      the opposite rock returned the salute to them again. This was succeeded
      with a most ravishing sound of voices in song, which continued till they
      came pretty near me; and then the first line, consisting of all the
      trumpets, mounting a considerable height, and still blowing, left room for
      the next ranks, about twenty abreast, to come forward beneath them; each
      of which dividing in the middle, alighted in ranks at about twenty paces
      distant from my right and left, making a lane before me, at the farther
      end of which Pendlehamby and his two daughters alighted with about twenty
      of his guards behind them, the remainder, consisting of about twenty more,
      coming forward over my head, and alighting behind me; and during this
      whole ceremony, the gripsacks sounded with such a din, it was astonishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Youwarkee, who knew nothing of my dress, or of the loss of my beard,
      was thunderstruck when she saw me, not being able to observe any visage I
      had for my great wig and hat; but putting a good face upon the matter, and
      not doubting but if the person she saw was not me, she should soon find
      her husband, for she knew the children by their clothes, she came forward
      at her father's right hand, I sitting as great as a lord, till they came
      within about thirty paces of my seat; and then gravely rising, I pulled
      off my hat and made my obeisance, and again at ten steps forwarder; so
      that I made my third low bow close at the feet of Pendlehamby, the
      children all doing the same. I then kneeling with one leg, embraced his
      right knee; who raising me up, embraced me. Then retiring three steps, and
      coming forward again, I embraced Youwarkee some time; during which the
      children observed my pattern with Pendlehamby, who took them up and kissed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I whispered Youwarkee to know if any more of her relations were in the
      train, to whom I ought to pay my compliments; she told me only her sister
      Hallycarnie, just behind her father. I then saluted her, and stepping
      forward to the old gentleman's left hand, I ushered him through the lines
      of guards to my chair; where I caused him to sit down with Youwarkee and
      Hallycarnie on each side, and myself on the left of Hallycarnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      After expressing the great honour done me by Pendlehamby in this visit, I
      told him I had a little grotto about half a mile through the wood, to
      which, if he pleased to command, we would retire; for I had only placed
      that seat to relieve him immediately upon his descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pendlehamby rose, and all the gripsacks sounded, he leading Youwarkee in
      his right hand, and I Hallycarnie in mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the grotto, my father being seated, taking Youwarkee in my hand, we
      paid our obedience to him. I would have asked his pardon for taking his
      daughter to wife without his leave, and was going on in a set speech I had
      studied for the purpose; but he refused to hear me, telling me I was
      mistaken, he had consented. I was replying I knew he had been so good as
      to pass it over, but that would not excuse&mdash;when he again interrupted
      me by saying, "If I approve it and esteem you, what can you desire more!"&mdash;So,
      finding the subject ungrateful, I desisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then gave each of them a silver can of Madeira, and Youwarkee retired. I
      soon made an excuse to follow her to learn if she was pleased with what I
      had done. Says she, "My dearest, what is come to you? I will promise you,
      but for fear of surprising my father, I had disowned you for my husband."&mdash;"Dear
      Youwee," says I, "do you approve my dress, for this is the English
      fashion?"&mdash;"This, Peter," says she, "I perceived attracted all eyes
      to you, and indeed is very showy, and I approve it in regard to those we
      are now to please; but you are not to imagine I esteem you more in this
      than your old jacket; for it is Peter I love in this and all things else;
      but step in again, I shall only dress, and come to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife, being dressed in her English gown, just crossed the room where my
      father sat, to see Dicky, who was in another side-room. I was then sitting
      by, and talking with him. "Son," says my father, "I understood you had no
      other woman in this arkoe but my daughter; for surely you have no child so
      tall as that," pointing to my wife.&mdash;"No, sir," said I, "that is a
      friend."&mdash;"Is she come to you," says he, "in my daughter's absence?"&mdash;"Oh,
      sir," says I, "she is very well known to my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst we were talking in comes Youwarkee with the child in her arms,
      which she kept covered to the wrists with her gown-sleeve, to hide her
      graundee; and playing with the child, talked only in English to it. "Is
      this your youngest son?" says my father.&mdash;I told him yes.&mdash;"Pray,
      madam," says I, "bring the child to my father."&mdash;"Madam," says he,
      "you have a fine baby in your arms; has his mother seen him since she came
      home?" He speaking this in his own tongue, and Youwarkee looking at me as
      if she could not understand him, I interpreted it to her. My sister then
      desired to see the child, but I was forced again to interpret there too.
      In short, they both talked with my wife near half an hour, but neither of
      them knew her; till at last, saying in her own language, "That is your
      granddaddy, my dear Dicky!" the old gentleman smoked her out.&mdash;"I'll
      be slit," says he, "if that is not Youwarkee!"&mdash;"It's impossible!"
      says Hallycarnie.&mdash;"Indeed, sister," says Youwarkee, "you are
      mistaken!" and my father protesting he had not the least suspicion of her,
      till she spoke in his tongue, rose and kissing her and the child, desired
      her to appear in that habit during his stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked Pedro what provision had been made for the guards: "Son," says my
      father, "I bring not this number of people to eat you up; they have their
      subsistence with them," and he would by no means suffer me to allow them
      any. I then desired to know if there were any officers or others to whom
      he would have shown any particular marks of distinction.&mdash;"Son," says
      the old glumm, "you seem to have studied punctilios; and though I should
      be sorry to incommode you for their sakes, if you could procure some
      shelter and sleep-room for about twenty of them who are superiors, ten at
      a time, while the rest are on duty, I should be glad." I told him I had
      purposely erected a tent, which would with great ease accommodate a
      greater number; and as they were of distinction, with his leave I insisted
      upon providing for them; to which, with some reluctance, I procured his
      consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pendlehamby was refreshed, he would go with me to see the officers'
      quarters, and showing him my tent, he having never seen such a thing
      before, was going to climb up the outside of it, taking it for earth.
      "Hold, sir," said I, "you cannot do so!" Then taking him to the front of
      it, I turned aside the blue cloth and desired him to walk in; at which he
      seemed wonderfully pleased, and asked me how it was made. I told him in as
      few words as I could; but he understood so little of it, that anything
      else I had said might have done as well. He mightily approved it; and
      calling the chief officer, I desired he would command my house, and that
      provision should be supplied to his quarters daily; at which he
      hesitating, I assured him I had my father's leave for what I offered;
      whereupon he stroked his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then asked him if he had any clever fellows under him to serve them, and
      dress their provisions; but he hoped, he said, they were ready dressed, as
      his men knew little of that matter; but for any other piece of service, as
      many as I pleased should be at my command.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ENDLEHAMBY having
      a mind to view my arkoe, took a long walk with Hallycarnie in the wood
      till dinner-time; and he having before told me that some of his guards
      always waited on him at meals, I ordered their dinner before his return,
      sending a large dish of cold fowls, cut into joints, into the tent, to be
      spread on clean leaves I had laid on the chests; and setting a sufficient
      quantity of bread and fish there also, I desired the officers present to
      refresh themselves now, and the rest when relieved should have a fresh
      supply. I saw there was an oddity in their countenances, which at first I
      did not comprehend; but presently turning about to the superior, "Sir,"
      says I, "though this food may look unusual to you, it is what my island
      affords, and you will be better reconciled to it after tasting." So taking
      a piece of fowl and dipping it in the salt, I ate a bit myself, and
      recommended another to him; who, eating it, they all fell to without
      further scruple, above all things commending the salt as what they had
      never tasted the like of before, though they thought they had both of the
      fish and fowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then told them where my supply of water came from, and that they must
      furnish themselves with that by their own men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the return of my father and sister, the gripsack sounded for dinner;
      when four officers on duty entering, desired, as their posts, to have the
      serving up of the dishes. One of them I perceived, having set on the first
      dish, never stirred from behind Pendlehamby; but upon his least word or
      sign, ordered the others what to do or bring, which he only presented to
      my father; and he frequently gave him a piece from his own plate; but the
      other officers served at the table promiscuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner I brought in a bowl of punch; when begging leave to proceed
      in my country method, I drank to my father's health. "So, daughter," says
      he to my wife, "we are at the old game again. Son," says he, "this is no
      novelty to me, Youwarkee constantly drinking to the health of her dear
      Peter, and the children at Graundevolet, and obliging us to pledge her, as
      she called it; but I thank you, and will return your civility;" so taking
      a glass, "son and daughter," says he, "long life, love, and unity attend
      you and my grandchildren!" Youwarkee and I both rising till he had done,
      returned him our thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had sat some time, "Son," says my father, "you and your wife
      having lived so retired, I fear my company and attendants must put you to
      an inconvenience; now, as my son intends you a visit also, in company with
      several of my brother colambs, if we shall be too great a load upon you,
      declare it, for they will be at Battringdrigg arkoe to-morrow, to know
      whether it will be agreeable for them to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, son," says my father, "the mouth is a great devourer, and that
      the stock your family cannot consume in a year, by multiplying their
      numbers, may be reduced in a day: now freely let me know (for you say you
      provided for us) how your stock stands, that you may not only pleasure us,
      but we not injure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him, as for dried fish I had a vast quantity, and that my fowls
      were so numerous I knew not my stock; as to bread, I had a great deal, and
      might have almost what more I would; and then for fresh fish, the whole
      province of Arndrumnstake could not soon devour them; but for my pickles
      and preserves, I had neither such large quantities, nor conveniences to
      bestow them if I had.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If this be the case, son," says my father, "I may send your brother word
      to proceed;" and despatched ten messengers with a gripsack to hasten his
      son's arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now began to be time for rest, and the old gentleman growing pretty
      mellow with the punch, which, by the heavy pulls he took at it, I
      perceived was no disagreeable entertainment to him, I conducted him to his
      repose; and disposing of the rest of the family, Youwarkee and I, with
      great impatience, retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may imagine I was sincerely glad to find myself once more alone with
      my Youwarkee; when, after a transport of mutual endearments, I desired to
      know how Pendlehamby first received her; which she told me, with every
      circumstance, in so affecting a manner that the tears forced passage from
      mine eyes in perfect streams; and I loved the dear man ever after as my
      own father.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me Tommy was in great favour at court before her brother returned
      from me; but ever since I sent him the flageolet he had been caressed
      above measure, and would soon be a great man; that Hallycarnie was a
      constant attendant on Jahamel both in her diversions and retirement; and,
      she did not doubt, would in time marry very well; as for Patty, she said
      her father intended, with my leave, to adopt her as his own child.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife slept very sound after her journey; but my hurry of spirits
      denying me that refreshment, I never so much as now lamented the want of
      the graundee.&mdash;"For," thinks I, "now I have once again tasted the
      sweets of society, how shall I ever relish a total desertion of it, which
      in a few days must be the case, when all this company are fled, and myself
      am reduced to my old jacket and water-cart again! Now, if I was as others
      here are, I might make a better figure than they by my superior knowledge
      of things, and have the world my own; nay, I would fly to my own country,
      or to some other part of the world, where even the strangeness of my
      appearance would procure me a good subsistence. But," says I, "if with my
      graundee I should lose my sight, or only be able to live in the dark in
      England, why, I should be full as bad as I am here! for nobody would be
      able to keep me company abroad, as my hours for the air would be theirs of
      retirement; and then, at home, it would be much the same; no one would
      prefer my company in a dark room in the daytime, when they could enjoy
      others in the light of the sun; then how should I be the better for the
      graundee, unless I fixed a resolution of living here, or hereabouts? and
      then to get into company, I must retire to still darker regions, which my
      eyes are no ways adapted to: in short, I must be quite new moulded, new
      made, and new born too, before I can attain my desires. Therefore, Peter,"
      says I, "be content; you have been happy here in your wife and children
      without these things; then never make yourself so wretched as to hope for
      a change which can never possibly happen, and which, perhaps, if obtained,
      might undo you; but intend only what you can compass, by weighing all
      circumstances, and your felicity will lie in very narrow bounds, free from
      two of the greatest evils a man can be beset by, hopes and fears; two
      inseparable companions, and deadly enemies to peace; for a man is
      destroyed by hope through fear of disappointment."&mdash;This brought me a
      show of peace again.&mdash;"Surely," says I, "I am one of the most
      unaccountable amongst mankind! I never can reflect till I am worn down
      with vexation. O Glanlepze! Glanlepze!" says I, "I shall never forget thy
      speech after engaging the crocodile, that everything was to be attained by
      resolution by him that takes both ends of a thing in his view at once, and
      fairly deliberates what may be given and taken from end to end. Surely,"
      says I, "this ought to be engraven on brass, as I wish it was on my heart;
      it would prevent me many painful hours, help me with more ease to compass
      attainable ends, and to rest contented under difficulties insuperable: and
      if I live to rise again, I will place it where it shall never be more out
      of my sight, and will enforce it not only more and more on myself, but on
      my children."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this thought I dropped to sleep, and with this I awaked again, and
      the first thing I did was to find a proper place to write it, which,
      having fixed for the door of my cupboard, I took a burnt stick for my
      pencil, and wrote as follows:&mdash;"He that is resolved to overcome, must
      have both ends of an object in view at once, and fairly deliberate what
      may be given and taken from end to end; and then pursue the dictates of
      cool reason." This I wrote in English, and then in the Doorpt Swangeantine
      tongue; and having read it twice or thrice over, I went for water and
      fish, and returned before the family were up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took care to-day also that the officers should be as well served as
      possible, and where an accommodation must be wanting, I rather chose to
      let it fall on my father than on them; for I had ever observed it to be an
      easier thing to satisfy the master than the man; as the master weighs
      circumstances, and from a natural complacency in himself, puts a humane
      construction upon that error or omission which the servant wholly
      attributes to slight and neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      My company being abroad, about the time I expected their return I dressed
      myself as the day before, only without my cloak, and in a black bob-wig,
      and took a turn to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pendlehamby spying me first among the trees, "Daughter Youwarkee," says
      he, "you have a husband, I think, for every day in the week. Who's this?
      my son Peter! Why, he is not the same man he was yesterday." She told him
      she had heard me say we changed our apparel almost every day in England;
      nay, sometimes twice or thrice the same day.&mdash;"What!" says
      Pendlehamby, "are they so mischievous there they are fearful of being
      known in the latter by those who saw them in the former part of the day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time I was come up, and after paying due compliments, says
      Youwarkee&mdash;"My father did not know you, my dear, you are so altered
      in your other wig; and I told him in your country they not only change
      wigs, but their whole clothing, two or three times a day sometimes."&mdash;"Son,"
      says my father, "if it be so, I cannot guess at the design of a man's
      making himself unlike himself."&mdash;"Oh, sir," says I, "it is owing to
      the different functions he is to perform that day: as, suppose, in the
      morning he is to pursue business with his inferiors, or meet at our
      coffee-houses to hear and chat over the news of the day, he appears in a
      light easy habit proper for despatch, and comes home dirty; then, perhaps,
      he is to dine with a friend at mid-day, before whom, for respect's sake,
      not choosing to be seen in his dirty dress, he puts on something
      handsomer; and after spending some time there, he has, it may be, an
      appointment at court, at play, or with his mistress, in all which last
      cases, if he has anything better than ordinary, it is a part of good
      breeding to appear in that; but if the very best was to be used in common,
      it might soon become the worst, and not fit for a nice man to stir abroad
      in."&mdash;"The different custom of countries you have told me of," says
      my father, "is surprising: here are we born with our clothes on, which
      always fit, be we ever so small or large; nay, are never the worse for
      constant wearing; and you must be eternally altering and changing colour,
      shape, and habit. But," says he, "where do they get all these things? Does
      every man make just what he likes?"&mdash;"No," says I, "there are a
      particular set of men whose business it is to make for all the rest."&mdash;"What!"
      says he, "I suppose their lasks make them?"&mdash;"No, sir, they are
      filgays," says I. "It is their trade, they do it for a livelihood, being
      paid by them they work for. A suit of their clothes," says I, taking up
      the flap of my coat, "will cost what we call twelve or fourteen pounds in
      money."&mdash;"I don't understand you," says he.&mdash;"Why, sir," says I,
      "that is as much as will provide one moderate man with all the necessary
      things of life for two months."&mdash;"Then," says he, "these nice men
      must be very rich."&mdash;"No, sir," said I, "there you are under a
      mistake; for if a man, very rich, and who is known to be so, neglects his
      habit, it is taken to be his choice; but one who is not known to be rich,
      and is really not so, is, by appearing gay sometimes, thought to be so;
      for he comes little abroad, and pinches miserably at home, first to get
      that gay suit, and then acts on the same part to preserve it, till some
      lucky hit may help him to the means of getting another, as it frequently
      happens, by a good marriage; for though he is but seldom seen in public,
      yet always appearing so fine when he is, the ladies, whose fancies are
      frequently more tickled with show than sense, admitting him only at first
      as a companion, are at last, if worth anything, taken in the toils he is
      ever spreading for them; and, becoming his wife, produce a standing fund
      to make him a rich man in reality, which he but personated before."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pendlehamby could not well understand all I said; and I found by him that
      all the riches they possessed were only food and slaves; and as I found
      afterwards when amongst them, they know the want of nothing else; but I am
      afraid I have put them upon another way of thinking, though I aimed at
      what we call civilising of them.

      than usual, I was awakened next morning by a gripsack from Quangrollart;
      upon hearing of which I roused immediately, thinking they were at my door;
      but the messenger told me they could not be there in what I understood by
      his signs to be about two hours, for they have no such measure for time as
      hours; so I dressed at leisure, and then went to Youwarkee and waked her.
      "Youwee," says I, "your brother will be here presently, and I having a

    </p>
    <p>
      We walked down to the level, and but just saved our distance; for the van
      of them were within the arkoe before we arrived, and with such a train
      after them as seemed to reach the whole length of the arkoe. The
      regularity and order of their flight was admirable, and the break of the
      trumpets so great, sounding all the way they came (for we had not only one
      set of them, but at least thirty, there being so many colambs and petty
      princes in the train, each with fifty attendants), that I wondered how
      they could bear it. As the principals alighted, which was at least a
      hundred paces from me, the gripsacks still kept wing, sounding as long as
      we stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a very tedious ceremony, for the guards alighting with their
      colambs, ranged just as Pendlehamby's had done, but reached as far as the
      eye could see. As they moved towards us, You-warkee and I, having stood
      still some time, moved slowly forward to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have surprised you to have seen the deference they paid us; and I
      believe the guards took us for something above the mortal race. You-warkee
      showed no part of her graundee, having on sleeves down to her wrists,
      white silk stockings and red-heeled shoes; so that none of them knew her
      for one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first that we met was my brother, to whom we had only an opportunity
      of paying our compliments <i>en passant</i> before another graundee came
      up, who was succeeded by another and another, to the number of thirty;
      some out of respect to my father and brother, and some out of mere
      curiosity to see me; and as fast as each had paid his salutes, he passed
      us, till we found we had no more to meet, when we turned about, and fell
      in with the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came to the grotto, I was very much put to it for room, we scarce
      being able to stand upright by each other, much less to sit down; which my
      father perceiving, "My dear friends," says he, "had my son known in time
      of so much good company, he would have been better provided with seats for
      us all; but considering all we see is the labour only of his own hands, we
      should rather admire at the many conveniences we see here, than be uneasy
      there are no more. And, son," says he, "as we are now so large a body, I
      propose we adjourn to the officers' quarters and let them take ours." I
      returned my father thanks for the hint, and led the way, the rest
      following, where we found room enough and to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Youwarkee was with us all dinner-time helping the guests, we had no
      sooner done, "But," says Quangrollart aloud, "Brother Peter, are we not to
      see my sister?" I not hearing perfectly what he said, though I perceived
      he spoke to me, "Sir," says I.&mdash;"My sister Youwarkee!" says he, "why
      won't she appear? Here are several of her good friends as well as myself
      will be glad to see her." My father then laughed so heartily that the rest
      taking notice of it, my poor brother was put to the blush. "Son," says my
      father, "don't you know your own sister?"&mdash;"We have not seen her
      yet," says one of the colambs, "or any lady but your daughter Hallycarnie
      and that attendant." My brother then seeing how it was came up to salute
      my wife; but even then had his scruples, till he saw her smile, and then
      begged pardon for his oversight, as did all the colambs upon saluting her;
      my brother declaring that, as she was somewhat behind me on the level, he
      had only paid her the respect of his chin, taking her for some one
      attending me. The colamb following my brother, assured her the little
      regard shown her by Quangrollart, who, he thought, should know best where
      to bestow his respects, was the reason of his taking no more notice of
      her; and each confessing his mistake arose from too nearly copying the
      steps of his immediate predecessor, they all made excuse, and the mistake
      made us very merry, till they proposed taking a turn in the woods, it
      being a great novelty to them, they said; but I begged they would leave me
      behind to prepare for their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having refreshed themselves after they came home, Quangrollart (being put
      upon it by some of the colambs) told me I could not render a more
      acceptable favour to the whole company than to relate to them an account
      of my adventures; "for though," says he, "I told them last night what I
      remembered to have heard from you, yet the variety was so great I could
      not deliver the facts in order as I heard them, but was obliged to take
      here a piece and there another, as they occurred to me, making rather
      several stories of it than a continued series of facts."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the colambs immediately seconded the motion, and desired me to begin.
      I then ordering a clear table and a bowl of punch, and having drank all
      the company's healths, began my narration, hoping to have finished it
      before bedtime; but they pressing me to be very particular, and frequently
      one or other requiring explanations upon particular facts, and then one
      making a remark upon something which another answered, and a third replied
      to, they got the talk out of my hands so long that, having lost themselves
      in the argument, and forgot what I said last, they begged my pardon and
      desired me to go on; when one, who in contemplation of one fact had lost
      best part of another, prayed me to go on from such an incident, and
      another from one before that; so that I was frequently obliged to begin
      half-way back again. This method not only spun out my story to a very
      great length, but instead of its being finished that evening, as I had
      proposed, it was scarce well begun before bedtime drew on; so I just
      having brought them to Angola, told them, as it grew late, if they
      pleased, I would finish the remainder next night, which they agreed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quangrollart then asked my father if he had been fishing since he came;
      but he told him he knew not what he meant. Then all the company desired I
      would show them what that was. I told them they might command me as they
      pleased; so we appointed the next morning for that exercise. "But,
      gentlemen," says I, "your lodging to-night gives me the greatest pain; for
      I know not what I shall do about that. I have a few beast-fish skins which
      are very soft and hairy, but not a sufficiency for so many friends as I
      would at present be proud to oblige; but I can lay them as far as they
      will go upon as much dry reeds and grass as you please." I then sent a
      servant to Youwarkee for the skins; after which, they one and all crying
      out if they had but good dry reeds they desired no better lodging, I
      despatched hands to bring away a large parcel of them to the tent, which
      they did in a trice. Then waiting on those few who lay at the grotto to
      their quarters, and having sent Youwarkee to her sister, I returned to the
      tent to take up my own lodging with those I had left there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not yet entered the tent when I heard a perfect tumult within, every
      one talking so loud, and all together, that I verily thought they had
      fallen out and were going to handicuffs. However, I resolved to go in
      amongst them and try to compose their difference; when just entering, and
      they spying me, several ran to me with each a skin in his hand, the rest
      following as fast as they could. "Gentlemen," says I, "I hoped to have
      found you all at rest."&mdash;"So we should have been," says one of them,
      "but for these what you call 'ems."&mdash;"It is my unspeakable
      misfortune," says I, "that I have no more at your service, and am sorry
      that I should cause them to be brought, since each of you cannot have
      one." Says one of them, "I don't want one, I have seen enough of it."&mdash;
      "Then, gentlemen," says I, "it is possible there may be so many more of
      that colamb's mind that there may be sufficient for those who desire
      them." They neither knew what to make of me nor I of them all this while;
      till an old colamb perceiving our mistake, "Mr. Peter," says he, "we have
      only had a dispute."&mdash;"I am sorry at my heart for it," says I, "but I
      perceived you were very warm before I entered, and am in great hopes of
      compromising matters to all your satisfactions."&mdash;"I was going," says
      the same colamb, "to tell you we had a dispute about what these things
      were, nothing else." I was then struck on a heap, being quite ashamed they
      should think I suspected they had been quarrelling for the skins; and how
      to come off I knew not. "You'll excuse me, sir," says I, "for expressing a
      concern that you could not each have one to examine into at the same time,
      that one of you need not have waited to make your remarks till the other
      had done."&mdash;"No occasion, no occasion for that, Mr. Peter," said they
      all together; "we shall have leisure enough to examine them to-morrow; but
      we want to know what they are, and where they grow."&mdash;"Gentlemen,"
      says I, "each of these is the clothing of a particular fish. And where do
      they grow?" said they. "In the lake," says I; "they are a living creature,
      who inhabit that great water; I often catch them when I am fishing, the
      same exercise we shall go upon to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had much ado to persuade them they did not grow on trees, which I was
      then much more surprised at than some time after, that I returned their
      visit; but having satisfied them, and given them some possible hopes they
      might see one alive next day, they were very well contented, and we all
      lay down to rest.

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Go afishing&mdash;Catch a beast-fish&mdash;Afraid of the gun&mdash;How
      Peter altered his net&mdash;Fish dinner for the guards&mdash;Method of
      dressing and eating it.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> APPEARED before
      them in the morning, in my old jacket, and an old hat with brims indented
      almost to the crown, a flannel nightcap, and chequered shirt. "How now,
      son!" says my father, "what have we here?"&mdash;"Sir," says I, "this will
      show you the use of our English fashion I mentioned the other day, and the
      necessity of it. You see me in this indifferent habit, because my next
      business requires it; but when I come back, and have no further dirty work
      to do, I shall then dress, as near as I can, to qualify me for your
      company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you for moving, gentlemen?" says my brother; "I believe it is time."
      They then all arising we went to the lake, where getting into my boat, and
      telling them that any six of them might go with me, they never having seen
      such a thing before, and not much liking the looks of it, all made
      excuses, till my brother assuring them it was very safe, and that he had
      sailed in it the last trip, three or four of them, with my father, and
      Hallycarnie, who was very desirous of seeing me fish, got in, and we
      sailed a great way up the lake, taking my gun as usual with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave me exceeding delight to see the whole body of people then in the
      arkoe on the graundee; some hovering over our heads, and talking with us;
      others flying this way, others that, till I had pitched upon a spot to
      begin my operation; when rowing to shore, and quitting my boat, the whole
      body of people settled just by me, staring at me and my net, and wondering
      what I was doing. I then taking a sweep as usual, got some of the soldiers
      to assist me to shore with it; but when the cod of the net landed, and the
      fish began to dash with their tails at the water's edge, away ran all my
      soldiers, frighted out of their wits to think what was coming: but it
      being a large hale, and a shelving bank, I could not lift it to the level
      myself; which my brother, who had seen the sport before, perceiving,
      though not one of the rest stirred, lent me a hand, and we got it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot imagine what surprise appeared in every face upon opening the
      net, and seeing all the fish naked. They drew up by degrees closer and
      closer, for I let the fish lie some time for their observation; but seeing
      the large fish, upon my handling them, flap their tails, they very
      expeditiously retired again. I then tossed several of them into the boat;
      but two of them being very large, and rough-scaled ugly fish, I did not
      think I could lift them myself, so desired assistance, but nobody stirred.
      I expected some of the colambs would have ordered their men to have helped
      me, but they were so terrified with seeing me handle them, that they could
      not have the conscience to order their men on so severe a duty, till a
      common man came to me, and taking the tail, and I the head, we tossed them
      both into the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went higher up the lake than usual, in hopes of a beast-fish to show
      them; but though I could not meet with one, I had several very great
      hauls, and took three or four of my lobsters, very large ones. This was
      the second trial I had made of my net since I had altered it, and it gave
      me great satisfaction, for I could now take as many fish at one draught as
      I could before have done at ten. I had found that though my net was very
      long, yet for want of a bag, or cod, to enclose the fish, many that were
      included within its compass would, whilst I drew round, swim to the
      extremes, and so get out, for want of some inlet to enter at; for which
      reason I sawed off the top of a tree at about ten feet from the ground,
      and drawing a circle of six feet diameter round the tree, on the ground, I
      stuck it round with small pegs, at two inches' distance. Then I drove the
      like number of nails round the top of the trunk of the tree, and straining
      a length of mat-line from each peg on the ground to a correspondent nail
      on the tree, I tied my matline in circles round the strained lines, from
      top to bottom, about two inches' distance at the bottom, but at a less
      distance where the strained lines grew nearer to each other towards the
      top; and having secured all the ends, by some line twisted round them, I
      cut a hole in the middle of my net, and tied the large ground-end over the
      hole in the net, and gathered the small end up in a purse, tying it up
      tight; and by this means I now scarce lost any fish which once were within
      the sweep of my net.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having had so good success, I had a design of returning, but thought, as I
      could now so easily entertain a multitude, I might as well take another
      haul or two, and make a handsome treat for the soldiery. Then coming up to
      my drill's mouth, I fixed my implements for a draught there, and beginning
      to draw up, I found great resistance in the net, and got two or three to
      help me; but, coming near shore, when the company saw the net tumble and
      roll, and rise and fall, they all ran as if they were mad, till I called
      them and told the colambs it was only one of the fish whose skins I had
      shown them; upon which, by that time I had discharged the fish from the
      net, they were all round me again; but no sooner had he got loose, than up
      he rose, whirled his wings, and at the same instant uttered such a groan
      that my whole company retreated again, thinking me somewhat more than a
      man, who could face so dreadful an enemy. I entreated them to come and
      view it; but finding no arguments could bring them nearer, I edged round
      till I got him between me and the water, and shot him dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the report of my gun the whole field was in the air, darting and
      screaming, as I have often seen a flight of rooks do on the same occasion;
      and I am apt to believe some of them never returned again, but went
      directly home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a little concerned to see the confusion I had caused; and laying
      down my gun, my brother, who though at a distance when I shot, knowing
      what I was at, and coming up to me, it put the rest upon their
      consideration; and they alighted one by one, at a distance, till they were
      all on the level again.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father and the colambs, who were the first that durst approach,
      wondered what I had done, and how the fish came to be dead, and whence so
      much fire and smoke proceeded, for they were sure I brought none with me,
      and asked me abundance of questions; but as I knew I must have occasion
      for answering to the same thing twenty times over, had I entered upon an
      explanation there, I deferred giving them satisfaction till we came home,
      when all at once might be capable of hearing what was said. So I told them
      the most necessary thing at present was to stow the fish in the boat; for
      it was the largest I had ever taken, and I could not wholly do it myself.
      I made several efforts for help, but in vain, till the same soldier who
      had helped me with one of the first fish, came to my relief, and desiring
      my orders what to do, assisted me; and the rest seeing the difficulty we
      both had to manage it, one or two more of them came up, and we shipped it
      on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then called the colambs to me, telling them I was sorry I had given such
      a general disturbance to them, by shooting the fish; but as they kept at
      too great a distance from me to have notice of my design, and if I had
      followed them the fish might have escaped before my return, I was obliged
      to do as I did, which was without any possibility of hurting them. But, as
      I had given them such a fright, I hoped they would this one day give me an
      opportunity of complimenting their guards with a fish-dinner, if we could
      any way contrive to dress it; for whoever did that must be able to bear
      the close light of a large fire. They all shook their heads but my
      brother, who told me he had in his retinue six men from Mount Alkoe,
      purposely retained for their strong sight, to attend him always to
      Crashdoorpt, who, he believed, for the benefit of the rest, would
      undertake the cookery if I would show them how. I desired he would give
      them orders to attend me on the other side of the lake, and I would
      instruct them at my landing; and then I crossed over with my booty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding the Mount Alkoe men waiting for my landing, I asked if they could
      bear the sight of fire. They told me they were used to much greater light
      and flames than I had ever seen, they believed.&mdash;"Very good," said I;
      "then get into my boat, three of you, and hand out that fish to the
      shore."&mdash;I found they were more afraid of the fish than of the fire,
      for not one of them stirred till I got in and tossed out several small
      ones; and then taking up a large one, "Help me, somebody!" says I, they
      looking a little at one another, till one of them venturing to take it,
      the rest fell heartily to work, and despatched the whole lading presently.
      I then laid a small parcel upon my cart, for our own eating and the
      officers', and sending them to the grotto, I gave the cooks their charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," says I, "my lads, do you serve all the rest of the fish as I do
      this," cutting it open at the same time, and throwing away the guts, "and
      I will send each of you such an instrument as I use here," pointing to my
      knife. "I shall order six large heaps of wood to the level, to be piled up
      there. When you have done the fish, do you set fire to the heaps, and let
      them burn till the flame is over and the coals are clear; then lay on your
      fish, and if any are too large to be manageable, cut them in proper
      pieces, and with sticks, which I will send you, turn them over and over,
      walking round the fire, and with the forked end of the stick toss the
      least off first, and afterwards the greater; but be sure throw the fish as
      far as ever you can from the fire, amongst the men, that they may not be
      obliged to come too near it: and in this manner go on, till either they
      have enough, or your fish are gone; and when you have done, come to the
      grotto for your reward."
    </p>
    <p>
      I then set abundance of hands to work to carry wood, to be laid in six
      heaps, two hundred paces from each other, and told them how to pile it. I
      then prepared six long taper sticks with forked ends, and ordered more
      hands to divide the fish equally to the piles. I sent others with salt and
      bread; and I ordered them to let me know when all was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these preparations were making, my tent-visitors had all dined, and
      my cart had returned with the beast-fish, which the company desired might
      be brought in, when every one passed his judgment upon it, and a long
      dissertation we had on the marvellous works of Collwar. I let them go on
      with their show, though I could have disproved most of their conclusions
      from the little knowledge I had of things; but I never was knight-errant
      enough to oppose my sentiments to a multitude already prepossessed on the
      other side of the question; for this reason, because I have ever observed
      that where several have imbibed the same ridiculous principle in infancy,
      they never want arguments, though ever so ridiculous, to support it; and
      as no one of them can desert it without impeaching the judgment of the
      rest, they encourage each other in their obstinacy, and quite out-vote a
      single person; and then, the laugh beginning on the strongest side,
      nothing is so difficult as to get it out of their hands. But when a single
      man in the wrong hears a just argument from a single antagonist which he
      cannot contradict, he imbibes its force, and whilst that lasts, as nothing
      but a better argument, with better reasons, can remove it, he from
      thenceforth adapts his adversary's reasons for his own, to oppose against
      his own former opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the height of our disputations on the beast-fish, came news that the
      broil was going to begin; and as I expected very good diversion at it, I
      invited the company to go see it, telling them, in my opinion, it would
      exceed the sport in taking them. We passed through the wood till we came
      amongst the shrubs, where I placed them to be out of harm's way; and the
      fire, which was now nothing but cinders, was of no inconvenience to them.
      They were pleased with it to perfection; for, first, the six men who
      walked round the fires, by the glowing light of the embers and the shining
      of their graundees, looked like men on fire; then, to see each fire
      surrounded with a circle of men at the diameter of near two hundred paces,
      as close as they could well stand, by a more distant shine of the fire,
      had a very pleasing effect; but when the broilers began to throw the fish
      about (for each man stood with some salt and a cut of bread in his hand),
      to see a body of a hundred men running for it, and whilst they were
      stooping and scrambling for that, to see a hot fish fall on the back of
      one, which was whipped off by another, who, scalding his mouth with it,
      threw it in the face of a third; when a fourth, fifth, and sixth, pulling
      it in pieces, ran away with it; and to see the different postures,
      courses, and groups, during this exercise and running feast, was the most
      agreeable farce my guests had ever seen in their lives; and, to the great
      saving of my liquors, kept us in the wood for full three hours, not a soul
      stirring till the feast was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spent best part of this evening in discourse on the passages of the
      day, the reflections on which not being concluded till bedtime, my
      adventures were postponed till the next night; but we had first concluded
      upon a shooting for the next morning (for they were all extremely desirous
      of knowing how I did it), at a time they should have opportunity of seeing
      me and making remarks; and I, being unwilling they should think me a
      conjuror, agreed to make them masters of part of the mystery of powder and
      ball.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS being the
      fifth morning, I cleaned up my best gun, and prepared my balls, and we all
      took a walk towards the bridge, every one admiring my gun as we went; but
      I could get none of them to carry it, and we had at least five hundred
      questions proposed about it. I told them they need not be afraid of it,
      for it was only wood and iron; but they knew nothing of iron. I then
      showed them how I made it give fire, by snapping the cock; they thought it
      was very strange. I then put a little powder in the pan, and made it
      flash, and showing them the empty pan, they would not be persuaded but I
      had taken away the powder before the flash, or else, they said, it was
      impossible that should be all gone upon flashing only; for they said it
      was a little nut, using the same word to express both nut and seed. I then
      desired one of them to put in some powder and snap it himself; but having
      prevailed with him to try the experiment, if I had not through caution
      held my hand upon the barrel, the gun had been on the ground, for the
      moment it flashed, he let go and ran for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a great inclination to gain the better of their prejudices, and used
      abundance of arguments to prove the gun as innocent a thing as a twig I
      took up; and that it was the powder which, when set on fire, the flame
      thereof wanting more room than the powder itself did, forced itself, and
      all that opposed it, out of the mouth of the gun with such fury as to make
      the noise they heard; and being just come to the rock, "Now," says I, "you
      shall see that what I tell you is true." They told me they desired nothing
      more than that I would make them understand it, for it was the strangest
      thing they had ever seen. "Well, then," says I, "observe; I put in this
      much powder only, and with this rag I stop it down close. Now," says I,
      "you see by the length of this stick that the rag and powder take up the
      space only of a finger's depth on the inside of the gun." They saw that
      plainly they said; "But how could that kill anything?"&mdash;"Now, look
      again," says I, "I put in a little more powder, as I did before when I
      made a flash, and you see there is a little hole from this powder through
      the side of the gun to the powder within. Do you observe that this
      communicates with that through this hole?"&mdash;"Yes," said they, they
      did.&mdash;"Now," says I, "when I put fire to this, it sets fire to that
      within, which fire turning to flame, and wanting room, bursts out at the
      mouth of the gun; and to show you with what force it comes out, here
      handle this round ball," giving them a bullet to handle; "you feel how
      heavy it is: now, can any of you throw this ball as far as that rock?" for
      I stood a good hundred paces from it.&mdash;They told me No.&mdash;"And
      don't you think," says I, "that if the force of the fire made by this
      powder can throw this ball to that rock, that force must be very great?"&mdash;They
      said, they thought it must, but believed it to be impossible.&mdash;"But,"
      says I, "if it not only throws it to the rock but beats out a piece of the
      stone, must not that be much more violent?" They agreed it must.&mdash;Then
      putting in the ball, "Now," says I, "we will try." I then ordered one to
      daub a part of the rock, about breast high, with some mud, and first to
      observe about it if the rock was anywhere fresh broken, or not; who,
      returning, reported that the rock was all of a colour and sound, but
      somewhat ragged all about the mud.&mdash;"Did you lay the mud on smooth?"
      says I. He replied, "Yes."&mdash;Then lifting up my gun, I perceived they
      were creeping off; so I took it down again, and calling, reasoned with
      them upon their fears. "What mischief," says I, "can you apprehend from
      this gun in my hand! Should I be able to hurt you with it, are you not all
      my friends or relations&mdash;could I be willing to do it? If the gun of
      itself could hurt, would I handle it as I do? For shame! be more
      courageous; rouse your reason, and stand by me; I shall take care not to
      hurt you. It looks as if you mistrust my love to you, for this gun can do
      nothing but what I direct it to." By such like persuasions, rough and
      smooth, I prevailed upon the major part of the colambs and officers to
      stand near me to see me fire, and then I shot; but though my words had
      engaged them to stand it, I had no sooner snapped but the graundees flew
      all open, though they closed again immediately; and then we fell to
      question and answer again. I desired them to walk to the rock; and sent
      the person who put up the mark before, to see and show us exactly what
      alteration there was. He told us there was a round hole in the mud,
      pointing to it, which he did not leave there, and taking away the mud, a
      thick shiver of the rock followed it. They then all agreed that the ball
      must have made both the hole in the mud and also splintered the rock, and
      stood in amaze at it, not being able to comprehend it: but, by all the art
      I had, I could not prevail with a man of them to fire the gun himself,
      till it had been buzzed about a good while, and at last came to my ears,
      that a common soldier behind said he should not be afraid of it if the
      gentleman would show him how.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then ordered the fellow to me, and he told me, with a composed look,
      that it had always been his way of thinking, that what he saw another do
      he could do himself, and could not rest till he had tried. "And, sir,"
      says he, "if this gun, as you call it, does not hurt you, why should it
      hurt me? And if you can make it hit that rock, why should not I, when you
      have told me how you manage it?"&mdash;"Are not you the man that first
      helped me up with the large fish yesterday?" says I. He told me he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was prodigiously pleased with the fellow's spirit, "And," says I, "my
      friend, if you will, and I live, you will hit it before you have done." I
      then showed him the sight of the gun, and how to hold it; and being
      perfect in that, "Now," says I, "shut your left eye, and observe with your
      right, till this knob and that notch are exactly even with each other and
      the middle of that mark; and when they are so, pull this bit with your
      fore-finger, holding the gun tight to your shoulder." He so exactly
      pursued my directions that he hit the very middle of the mud; and then,
      without any emotion, walked up with the gun in his hand, as I had done
      before; and turning to me very gravely, "Sir," says he, "it is hit." I
      told him the best marksman on earth could not be sure of coming so near
      his mark. He stroked his chin, and giving me the gun again, was walking to
      his place; but I stopped him, and seeing something so modest and sincere
      in his countenance and behaviour, and so generous in his spirit, I asked
      him to which colamb he belonged. He told me to colamb Pendlehamby.&mdash;"To
      my father?" says I; "then sure I shall not be denied."
    </p>
    <p>
      I took him with me to my father, who was not yet come up to the rock.
      "Sir," says I, "there is a favour I would beg of you."&mdash;"Son," says
      he, "what is it you can ask that I can refuse you?" Says I, "'This man
      belongs to your guards; now there is something so noble and daring in his
      spirit, and yet so meek and deserving in his deportment, that if you will
      load me with obligation, it is to make him an officer; he is not deserving
      of so ill a station as a private man."
    </p>
    <p>
      My father looking at me, "Son," says he, "there is something to be done
      before he can be qualified for what you require." This, thinks I, is a
      put-off. "Pray, sir," says I, "what can a man of courage, sense, and a
      cool temper, want to qualify him for what I ask?"&mdash;"'Something," says
      he, "which none but myself can give; and that, at your desire, I will
      supply him with." Then, my father calling him, "Lask Nasgig, bonyoe," says
      he; that is, Slave Nasgig, lie down. Nasgig (for that was his name)
      immediately fell on his face, with his arms and hands straight by his
      sides; when my father, setting his left foot on Nasgig's neck, pronounced
      these words: "Lask, I give thee life, thou art a filgay!" Then Nasgig,
      raising himself on his knees, made obeisance to my father, and standing
      up, stroked his chin; and my father taking him by the hand in token of
      equality, the ceremony ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, son," says my father, "let me hear your request."&mdash;"It is only,
      sir," said I, "preferment for the deserving, equal to his merit." My
      father asked him if he understood the duty of a gorpell. He did not reply
      yes, but beginning, gave a compendious sort of history of his whole duty;
      at which all the colambs were very much surprised, for even his comrades
      were not apprised, or ever imagined, he knew more of military affairs than
      themselves. My father then asked him if he knew how to behave as a duff;
      but he made as little difficulty of that as the other, going through the
      several parts of duty in all the different branches, in peace and war, at
      home and abroad. "Son," says my father, "it is a mystery to me you should
      have found out more in an hour than I myself could in half an age; for
      this man was born in my palang, of my own lask, and has been mine and my
      father's these forty years. I shall be glad if you will look on the rest
      of my lasks, and give me your opinion; I may have more as deserving." I
      told him such as Nasgig were not to be met with very often; but when they
      were found, ought to be cherished accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," says I, "nature works upon the same sort of materials divers ways;
      on some in sport, and some in earnest; and if the necessary qualifications
      of a great man are impressed on our mass, it is odds but we improve
      regularly into one, though it may never be publicly known, or even to
      ourselves, till a proper occasion; for as a curious genius will be most
      inquisitive after, and is most in the end retentive of knowledge, so no
      man is less ostentatious of it. He covets knowledge, not from the prospect
      of gain, but merely for its own sake; the very knowing being his
      recompense: and if I may presume to give you a hint how properly to bestow
      your favours, let it be on persons like this; for the vain, knowing man,
      who is always showing it, as he for the most part labours for it, to show
      out with, and procure his rise by it, were it not for the hopes of that,
      would not think knowledge worth attaining; and as his rise is his aim, if
      he could invent any more expeditious method than that, he would not
      pretermit any ill act that might advance him according to his lust of
      rising. But the man who aims at perfection, from his natural inclination,
      must, to attain his end, avoid all ill courses, as impediments to that
      perfection he lusts after; and that, by Nasgig's worth being so little
      known, I'll answer for it is his character. And this being true, yourself
      will deduce the consequence, which is the fitter man to bear place; for
      with me it is a maxim, he that labours after truth for truth's sake (and
      that he surely must who proposes no worldly view in it) can't arrive at
      his ends by false methods, but is always the truest friend to himself and
      others, the truest subject to his lord, and the most faithful servant to
      his God."
    </p>
    <p>
      My father then turning to me, "Son," says he, "you have enlightened me
      more than ever I was before, and have put me on a new way of thinking, for
      which I am to return you many thanks." And the whole company doing the
      same, says my father, "I lost a brave general officer lately, who was
      destined to the western wars which are breaking out, and have been long
      debating in my mind to whom I should commit his corps; and but for the
      hazard of the enterprise, I would have now given it to Nasgig; but shall
      be loth to lose him so soon after I am acquainted with his worth, so will
      think of some other post nearer my person for him, less dangerous, though
      perhaps not so honourable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great sir," says Nasgig, "I am too sensible of the honour already done
      me, to think any post wherein I may continue to serve you either too mean
      or too hazardous for me; and as valour is nowhere so conspicuous as in the
      greatest dangers, I shall esteem my blood spent to great advantage in any
      enterprise where my duty under your command leads me. I therefore rather
      humbly request this dangerous post, that I may either lose my life in your
      service, or live to see you justified in your advancement of me by the
      whole nation. For what can I do, or how can I demonstrate my affection to
      your person and pleasure, in an inactive state?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the whole level rang with applause to Nasgig.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father then giving his hand to Nasgig, in token of friendship, and his
      word for investiture in the command of that vacant post, the whole level
      again resounded with, "Long live Pendlehamby, and his servant Nasgig!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This being the last day of my company's stay, for they had agreed to go
      homewards next morning, some of them moved to return the sooner, that they
      might have time to hear out my story. So that our stay was very little
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our return home, Nasgig singled me out to return his acknowledgments
      for my favour; and viewing my gun told me they had no such thing growing
      in his country. I told him if he had it, it would do no good without my
      powder. I then, at his request, described what I had heard of our method
      of fighting in battle in Europe; and mentioning our cannon, he said he
      supposed they killed every man they hit. "No," says I, "not so bad as
      that. Sometimes they hit the flesh only, and that is commonly cured;
      sometimes break a leg or arm, and that may in time be cured&mdash;some so
      well as to be useful again, and others are cut off, and healed up again;
      but if the ball hits the head or vitals, it is commonly mortal."&mdash;"Oh,"
      says he, "give me the head or vitals, then; no broken limbs for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, at their request, I went on with my story, at repairing the
      castle, and my escape with Glanlepze, and so on to the crocodile; when I
      repeated his speech to me on that account, and told them it had made such
      an impression upon me that I had endeavoured to make it the leading
      thought of my mind, and had set it down upon one of my doors at the grotto
      that it might the oftener be in my sight when any difficulty arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the colambs begged pardon for interrupting, but told me, though he
      understood what Glanlepze meant, he could not tell how I could set what he
      said down at my grotto, or have it in my sight, and desired me to explain
      that. I would have told my guest I took it down in writing, if that would
      not have puzzled the cause more; but to go the nearest way I could, I told
      him we had a method in my country of conveying to a man at a great
      distance whatever we have a mind to say to him, and in such a manner that
      nobody but himself would know what we would have him know. And pausing
      here a little to consider the easiest method of demonstrating this to
      their senses, they told me they had gone as far as their conjectures could
      carry them, but could conclude on nothing so improbable as sending it by a
      messenger. I told them that in part was my way, but my messenger should
      not know the message he carried. That gravelled them quite, and they were
      unanimous that was what could not be done. By this time I had sent for a
      wood-coal, to write with upon my deal table, and kneeling down to the
      table, I began to write, "Honoured sir, I send this to gain by your answer
      to it an account of your arrival at Arndrumnstake." I then called them all
      to me. "Now," says I, "suppose I want to know how my father gets back to
      Arndrumnstake, my way is this&mdash;I set down so many words as will
      express my meaning to my father, after the manner you see on this table,
      and make a little distance between each word, which is the same thing as
      you do in speaking; for there, if you run one word into another, and don't
      give each its proper sound, who can understand you? For though you speak
      what contains all the words, yet without the proper sound and distinction
      it is only confusion. Do you understand that?" They told me they did.
      "Then," says I, "these are the words I would have my father know, I being
      at this arkoe, and he at Arndrumnstake. Honoured sir," and so I read on.
      "Here," says I, "you must take us to be countrymen, and that he and I
      understand both the same method. Now look, this word, which ends where you
      see the gap, stands for <i>honoured</i>, and this next for <i>sir</i>, the
      next for <i>I</i>, and so on; and we both using the same method, and
      seeing each other's words, are able to open our minds at a distance." I
      was now in hopes I had done, and was going on with my story: "But," says
      one of the colambs, "Mr. Peter, though this is a matter that requires
      consideration, I plainly see how you do it, by agreeing that all these
      strokes put into this form shall stand for the word honoured, and so on,
      as you say, let who will make them; but have not you set down there the
      word Arndrumnstake?"&mdash;"Yes," says I.&mdash;"Why then," says he, "none
      of your countrymen could understand what that means."&mdash;"No," says I,
      smiling; "but they could."&mdash;Says he, "You say you agree what strokes
      shall stand for one word, and what for another; but then how could your
      countrymen, who never knew what strokes you would set down for
      Arndrumnstake, know that your strokes meant that very country? for that
      you could not have agreed upon before either of you knew there was any
      such place."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was at a loss, without spending more words than I was willing about it,
      how to answer this close reasoner; and talking of syllables and letters
      would only have perplexed the affair more, so I told him the readiest for
      despatch; that as every word consisted of one or more distinct sounds, and
      as some of the same sounds happened in different words, we did not agree
      so much upon making our strokes stand for several words, as for several
      sounds; and those sounds, more or less of them, added together, made the
      particular words. "As, for example," says I, "<i>Arn</i> is one sound, <i>drumn</i>
      is another sound, and <i>stake</i> is another; now, by our knowing how to
      set down these several sounds by themselves, we can couple them, and apply
      them to the making up any word, in the manner we please; and therefore he,
      by seeing those three sounds together, knows I mean <i>Arndrumnstake</i>,
      and can speak it as well, though he never heard the whole word spoken
      together, as if he heard me speak to him."&mdash;"I have some little
      notion of what you mean," says he, "but not clear enough to express myself
      upon it; and so go on! go on! And pray what did you do about the reeds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I then resuming my discourse where I left off, completed my narration that
      night; but I could perceive the water in my father's eyes when I came to
      the account of Youwarkee's fall and the condition I took her up in.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had done, they adjusted the order of their flight, for avoiding
      confusion, one to go so long before another, and the junior colambs to go
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning nothing was to be heard but the gripsacks: the men were all
      ranged in order to go off with their respective colambs; and after all
      compliments passed, the junior colamb arising, walked half-way to the
      wood, where his gripsack standing to wait for him, preceded him to the
      level, the next gripsack standing ready to sound as soon as the first
      removed; and this was the signal for the second colamb to move, so that
      each colamb was a quarter of a mile before the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father was the last but two; but I shall never forget his tenderness at
      parting with his daughter and grandchildren, and I may say with myself
      too; for by this time he had a high opinion of me. Patty went with my
      father, she so much resembling my wife, that my father said he should
      still have his two daughters in his sight, having her with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At parting, I presented Nasgig with a broadsword; and showing him the use
      of it, with many expressions of gratitude on his part, and respect on
      mine, he took flight after the rest.

      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Peter finds his stores low&mdash;Sends Youwarkee to the ship&mdash;Receives
      an invitation to Georigetti's court.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR the first few
      days after our company had left us, Youwarkee could not forbear a tear now
      and then for the loss of her father and sister; but I endeavoured not to
      see it, lest I should, by persuading her to the contrary, seem to oppose
      what I really thought was a farther token of the sweetness of her
      disposition; but it wore off by degrees, and having a clear stage again,
      it cost us several days to settle ourselves and put our confused affairs
      in order; and when we had done we blessed ourselves that we could come and
      go, and converse with the pleasing tenderness we had hitherto always done.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me nothing in the world but her concern for so tender a father,
      and the fear of displeasing me if she disobliged him, should have kept her
      so long from me; for her life had never been so sweet and serene as with
      me and her children; and if she was to begin it again, and choose her
      settlement and company, it should be with me in that arkoe. I told her
      though I was entirely of her opinion for avoiding a life of hurry, yet I
      loved a little company, if for nothing else but to advance topics for
      discourse, to the exercise of our faculties; but I then agreed it was not
      from mere judgment I spoke, but from fancy. "But, Youwee," says I, "it
      will be proper for us to see what our friends have left us, that we don't
      want before the time comes about again." Then she took her part, and I
      mine; and having finished, we found they would hold out pretty well, and
      that the first thing to be done was to get the oil of the beast-fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came to examine the brandy and wine, I found they had suffered
      greatly; so I told Youwarkee, when she could spare time, she should make
      another flight to the ship. "And," says I, "pray look at all the small
      casks of wine or brandy, or be they what they will, if they are not above
      half-full, or thereabouts, they will swim, and you may send them down." I
      desired her to send a fire-shovel and tongs, describing them to her: "And
      there are abundance of good ropes between decks, rolled up, send them,"
      says I, "and anything else you think we want, as plates, bowls, and all
      the cutlasses and pistols," says I, "that hang in the room by the cabin:
      for I would, me-thinks, have another cargo, as it may possibly be the
      last, for the ship can't hold for ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Youwarkee, who loved a jaunt to the ship mightily, sat very attentive to
      what I said, and told me, if I pleased, she would go the next day; to
      which I agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stayed on this trip till I began to be uneasy for her, being gone
      almost four days, and I was in great fear of some accident; but she
      arrived safe, telling me she had sent all she could any ways pack up; and
      any one who had seen the arrival of her fleet would had taken it for a
      good ship's cargo, for it cost me full three weeks to land and draw them
      up to the grotto; and then we had such a redundancy of things, that we
      were forced to pile them upon each other to the top of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began to draw towards long days again, when one morning, in bed, I
      heard the gripsack. I waked Youvarkee, and told her of it; and-we both got
      up, and were going to the level, when we met six glumms in the wood, with
      a gripsack before them, coming to the grotto. The trumpeter, it seems, had
      been there before; but the others, who seemed to be of a better rank, had
      not. We saluted them, and they us; and Youwarkee knowing one of them, we
      desired them to walk to the grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      They told us they came express from Georigetti's palace, with an
      invitation to me and Youwarkee to spend some time at his court. I let them
      know what a misfortune I lay under in not being born with a graundee,
      since Providence had pleased to dispose of me in a part of the world where
      alone it could have been of such infinite service to me, or I should have
      taken it for the highest honour to have laid myself at their master's
      feet: and after some other discourse, one of them pressed me to return his
      master my answer, for they had but a very little time to stay. I told them
      they saw plainly, by baring my breast to them, that I was under an
      absolute incapacity for such a journey, and gratifying the highest
      ambition I could have in the world; for I was pinned down to my arkoe,
      never more to pass the barrier of that rock. One of them then asking, if I
      should choose to go if it was possible to convey me thither, I told him he
      could scarce have the least doubt, was my ability to perform such a
      journey equal to my inclination to take it, that I should in the least
      hesitate at obeying his master. "Sir," says he, "you make me very happy in
      the regard you show my master; and I must beg leave to stay another day
      with you." I told him they did me great honour; but little thought what it
      all tended to.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were very facetious; and they talked of the number of visitors I had
      had here; and they mentioned several facts which had happened, and,
      amongst the rest, that of Nasgig, who, they said, since his return, had
      been introduced by Pendlehamby to the king, and was, for his great
      prudence and penetration, become Georigetti's great favourite. They told
      me war was upon the point of breaking out, and several other pieces of
      news, which, as they did not concern me, I was very easy about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning they desiring to walk, and view what was most remarkable
      in my arkoe, and above all to see me fire my gun, which they had heard so
      much of; I gratified them at a mark, and hit the edge of it, and found
      them quite staunch, without the least start at the report. I paid them a
      compliment upon it, and told them how their countrymen had behaved, even
      at a second firing: "But," says he who was the chief spokesman, and knew,
      I found, as much as I could tell him, "that second fright was from seeing
      death the consequence of the first; and though you had then to do mostly
      with soldiers, you must not think they choose death more than others,
      though their duty obliges them to shun it less."
    </p>
    <p>
      The same person then desired me to show him how to fire the gun; which I
      did, and believe he might hit the rock somewhere or other; but he did not
      seem to admire the sport, and I, having but few balls left, did not
      recommend the gun to the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before bedtime the strangers told me they believed I should see
      Nasgig next morning. I presently thought there was somewhat more than
      ordinary in this visit, but could noways dive to the bottom of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before they went to rest, they ordered the trumpeter to be early on
      the rock next morning; and upon the first sight of Nasgig's corps, to
      sound notice of it, for us to be ready to receive him.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E were waked by
      the trumpet giving notice of Nasgig's coming; I did not care to inquire of
      the strangers into the particulars of his embassy; "for be it what it
      will," thinks I, "Nasgig is so much my friend that I can know the motives
      of it from him, and, or I am much deceived, he is too honest to impose
      upon me." But I had but little time for thought, for upon our entering the
      level, we found him and his train, of at least a hundred persons, just
      alighting before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We embraced, and professed the particular pleasure fortune had done us in
      once more meeting together. When we arrived at the grotto, he told me he
      was assured I had been informed of the occasion of his visit; and that it
      would be the greatest honour done to his country that could be imagined.
      He then laid his hand on my beard, which was now of about five months'
      growth, having never shaved it since my father went, and told he was glad
      to see that.&mdash;"And are you not so to see me?" says I.&mdash;"Yes,
      surely," says he, "for I prize that for your sake."&mdash;"But," says I,
      "pray be open with me, and tell me what you mean by my being informed of
      the occasion of your coming?"&mdash;"Why," says he, "of Georigetti's
      message to you, as it will be of such infinite service to our country:
      and," says he, "if you had not consented to it, the messengers had
      returned and stopped me."&mdash;"True," says I, "one of the messengers
      told me the king would be glad to see me; which as I, so well as he, knew
      it was impossible he should, in return to his compliment, I believe I
      might say what a happiness it would be to me if I could wait on him. But
      pray what is your immediate message? for I hear you are in great favour at
      court, and would never have come hither with this retinue in so much
      ceremony on a trifling account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Peter," says Nasgig, "know that your fame has reached far and
      near since I saw you before; and our state, though a large and populous
      one, and once of mighty power and twice its present extent, by the revolt
      of the western part of it, who chose themselves a king, has been so
      miserably harassed by wars, that the revolters, who are ever fomenting
      discontent and rebellion amongst us, will, by the encroachments they daily
      make on us, certainly reduce us at last to a province under their
      government; which will render us all slaves to a usurped power, set up
      against our lawful sovereign. Now these things were foretold long enough
      before they actually began to be transacted; but all being then at peace,
      and no prospect of what has since happened, we looked not out for a
      remedy, till the disease became stubborn and incurable."&mdash;"Pray,"
      says I, "by whom were the things you mention foretold?"&mdash;"By a very
      ancient and grave ragan," says he.&mdash;"How long ago?" says I.&mdash;"Oh,
      above four times the age of the oldest man living," says he.&mdash;"And
      when did he say it would happen?" says I.&mdash;"That," says he, "was not
      quite so clear then."&mdash;"But how do you know," says I, "that he ever
      said any such thing?"&mdash;"Why, the thing itself was so peculiar," says
      he, "and the ragan delivered it so positively, that his successors have
      ever since pronounced it twelve times a year publicly, word for word, to
      put the people in mind of it, and from whom they must hope for relief; and
      now the long-expected time being come, we have no hopes but in your
      destruction of the tyrant-usurper."&mdash;"I destroy him!" says I: "if he
      is not destroyed till I do it, I fear your state is but in a bad case."&mdash;"My
      good friend Peter," says he, "you or nobody can do it."&mdash;"Pugh," says
      I, "Nasgig, I took you for a man of more sense, notwithstanding the
      prejudices of education, than to think, because you have seen me kill a
      beast-fish that could not come to hurt me at the distance of twenty paces,
      that I can kill your usurper at the distance he is from me."&mdash;"No, my
      good friend," says Nasgig, "I know you take me to have more judgment than
      to think so."&mdash;"Why, what else can I do," says I, "unless he will
      come hither to be killed by me?"&mdash;"Dear Peter," says he, "you will
      not hear me out."&mdash;"I will," says I, "say on."&mdash;"You, as I said
      before, being the only person that can, according to our prediction,
      destroy this usurper and restore peace among us, my master Georigetti, and
      the whole state of Normnbdsgrsutt, were going to send a splendid embassy
      to you; but your father advising to repose the commission wholly in me,
      they all consented to it, and I am come to invite you over to Brandleguarp
      for that purpose. I know you will tell me you have not the graundee, and
      cannot get thither: but I am assured you have what is far better; the
      wisdom you have will help you to surmount that difficulty, which our whole
      moucheratt cannot get over. And I am sure did you apply half the thought
      to accomplish it you seem to do to invent excuses against it, you would
      easily overcome that. And now, dear friend," continues he, "refuse me not;
      for as my first rise was owing to your favour, so my downfall as
      absolutely attends your refusal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Nasgig," says I, "you know I love you, and could refuse you nothing
      in my power; but for me to be mounted in the air, I know not how, over
      these rocks, and then drowned by a fall into the sea, which is a necessary
      consequence of such a mad attempt; and all this in prosecution of a
      project founded upon an old wife's tale, is such a chimera as all men of
      sense would laugh at; as if there was no way of destroying me, but with a
      guard of a hundred men to souse me into the wide ocean. A very pretty
      conqueror of rebels I should prove, truly, kicking for life till the next
      wave sent me to the bottom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig looked then so grave, I almost thought I should have heard no more
      of it; but after a short pause, "Peter," says he, "I am sorry you make so
      light of sacred things; a thing foretold so long ago by a holy ragan, kept
      up by undoubted tradition ever since, in the manner I have told you; in
      part performed, and now waiting your concurrence for its accomplishment;
      but if I cannot prevail with you, though I perish at my return, I dread to
      think you may be forced without thanks to perform what generously to
      undertake will be your greatest glory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray," says I, "Nasgig (for now I perceive you are in earnest), what may
      this famous prediction be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Peter!" says Nasgig, "to what purpose should I relate so sacred a
      prediction to one who, though the most concerned in it, makes such a jest
      of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His mentioning me as concerned in it, raised my curiosity once more to
      desire a relation of it. "Why should I relate it," says he, "if you are
      resolved not to fulfil it?"&mdash;I told him I had no resolution against
      anything that related to my own good, or that of my friends. "But the
      greatest question with me," says I, "is, whether I am at all concerned in
      it."&mdash;"Oh clearly, clearly!" says he, "there is no doubt of it; it
      must mean you or nobody."&mdash;I told him I must judge by the words of it
      that I was the person intended by it; and till that was apparent to my
      reason, it would be difficult to procure my consent to so perilous an
      undertaking.&mdash;"And," says he, "will you, upon hearing it, judge
      impartially, and go with me if you can take the application to yourself?"&mdash;"I
      cannot go quite so far as that," says I; "but this I'll promise you, I'll
      judge impartially, and if I can so apply it to myself, that it must
      necessarily mean me, and no other, and if you convince me I may go safely,
      I will go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig was so rejoiced at this, he was at a loss how to express himself.
      "My dear Peter," says he, "you have given me new life! our state is free!
      our persons free! we are free! we are free! And, Peter," says he, "now I
      have given vent to my joy, you shall hear the prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must know, this holy ragan lived four ages ago; and from certain
      dreams and revelations he had had, set himself to overturn our
      country-worship of the Great Image; and by his sanctity of life, and sound
      reasonings, had almost effected it under the assistance of Begsurbeck,
      then our king, who had fully embraced his tenets; but the rest of the
      ragans opposing him, and finding he could not advance his scheme, he
      withdrew from the ragans to a close retirement for several years; and just
      before his death, sending for the king and all the ragans, he told them he
      should certainly die that day, and that he could not die at peace till he
      had informed them what had been revealed to him; desiring them to take
      notice of it, not as a conjecture of his own, but a certain verity which
      should hereafter come to pass. Says he, 'you know you have rejected the
      alteration in your religion I proposed to you; and which Begsurbeck, here
      present, would have advanced; and now I must tell you what you have
      brought upon yourselves. As for Begsurbeck, he shall reign the longest and
      most prosperously of all your former and future kings; but in twice his
      time outrun, the west shall be divided from the east, and bring sorrow,
      confusion, and slaughter, till the waters of the earth shall produce a
      glumm, with hair round his head, swimming and flying without the graundee;
      who, with unknown fire and smoke, shall destroy the traitor of the west,
      settle the ancient limits of the monarchy, by common consent establish
      what I would have taught you, change the name of this country, introduce
      new laws and arts, add kingdoms to this state, and force tributes from the
      bowels of the earth of such things as this kingdom shall not know till
      then, and shall never afterwards want; and then shall return to the waters
      again. Take care,' says he, 'you miss not the opportunity when it may be
      had; for once lost, it shall never, never more return; and then, woe, woe,
      woe to my poor country!'&mdash;The ragan having said this, expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This prediction made so great an impression on Begsurbeck, that he
      ordered all the ragans singly before him, and heard them repeat it; which
      having done, and made himself perfect in it, he ordered it to be
      pronounced twelve times in the year on particular days, in the moucherait,
      that the people might learn it by heart; that they and their children
      being perfect in it, might not fail of applying it, when the man from the
      waters should appear with proper description.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus, Peter," says he, "has this prediction been kept up in our memories
      as perfectly as if it had but just been pronounced to us."&mdash;:"'Tis
      very true," says I, "here may have been a prediction, and it may have
      been, as you say, handed down very exactly from Begsurbeck's days till
      now; but how does that affect me? how am I concerned in it? Surely, if any
      marks would have denoted me to be the man, some of the colambs who have so
      lately left me, and were so long with me, would have found them out in my
      person, or among the several actions of my life I recounted to them."&mdash;"Upon
      the return of the colambs from you," says Nasgig, "they told his majesty
      what they had heard and seen at Graundevolet, and the story was conveyed
      through the whole realm: but every man has not the faculty of distinction.
      Now, one of the ragans, when he had heard of you, applying you to the
      prediction, and that to you, soon found our deliverer in you; and at a
      public moucheratt, after first pronouncing the prediction, declared
      himself thereon to the following effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'May it please your majesty&mdash;and you the honourable colambs&mdash;the
      reverend ragans&mdash;and people of this state,' says he, 'you all know
      that our famous king Begsurbeck, who reigned at the time of this
      prediction, did live sixty years after it in the greatest splendour, and
      died at the age of one hundred and twenty years, having reigned full
      ninety of them; and herein you will all agree with me, no king before or
      since has done the like. You all likewise know, that within two hundred
      years after Begsurbeck's death, that is, about twice his reign of ninety
      years outrun, the rebellion in the west began, which has been carried on
      ever since; and our strength diminishing as theirs increases, we are now
      no fair match for them, but are fearful of being undone. So far you will
      agree matters have tallied with the prediction; and now, to look forward
      to the time to come, it becomes us to lay hold of the present opportunity
      for our relief, for that, once slipped, will never return; and if I have
      any skill in interpretations, now is the time of our deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Our prediction foretells the past evils, their increase and continuance,
      till the waters of the earth shall produce a glumm. Here I must appeal to
      the honourable colambs present, if the waters have not done so in the
      person of glumm Peter of Graundevolet, as they have received it from his
      own report.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the colambs then rising, and making reverence to the king, declared
      it was most true.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The next part,' says the ragan, 'is, he is to be hairy round his head;
      and how his person in this respect agrees with the prediction, I beg leave
      to be informed by the colambs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The colambs then rising, declared that having seen and conversed with
      him, they could not observe any hair on the fore part of his head; but I
      answered that when I left you I well remembered your having short stubbs
      of hair upon your cheeks and chin; which I had no sooner mentioned than
      your father arose and told the assembly that though he did not mind it
      whilst he was with you, yet he remembered that his daughter, a year
      before, had told him that you had hair on your face before as long as that
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This again putting new life into the ragan, he proceeded&mdash;'Then let
      this,' says he, 'be put to the trial by an embassy to glumm Peter; and if
      it answers, there will be no room to doubt the rest. Then,' says the
      ragan, 'it is plain by the report of the colambs, that glumm Peter has not
      the graundee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As to the next point, he is to swim and fly. Now I am informed he swims
      daily in a thing he calls a boat.'&mdash;To which the colambs all agreed.&mdash;'And
      now,' says he, 'that he flies too, that must be fulfilled; for every word
      must have a meaning, and that indeed he must do if ever he comes hither. I
      therefore advise that a contrivance be somehow found out for conveying
      glumm Peter through the air to us, and then we shall answer that part of
      the prediction; and I think, and do not doubt, but that may be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Now,' says he, 'let us see the benefit predicted to us upon the arrival
      of glumm Peter. Our words are: "Who, with unknown fire and smoke, shall
      destroy the traitor of the west." What can be plainer than this? For I
      again appeal to the colambs for his making unknown fire and smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thus far,' says the ragan, 'we have succeeded happily towards a
      discovery of the person; but it ends not here with the death of the
      traitor; but such other benefits are to accrue as are mentioned in the
      following part of the prediction: they are blessings yet to come, and who
      knows the end of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I hope,' says the ragan, 'I have given satisfaction in what I have said,
      and shall now leave it to the care of those whose business it is to
      provide that none of those woes pronounced against us may happen, by
      missing the time which, when gone, will never return.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The assembly were coming to a resolution of sending you a pompous
      embassy, but your father prevailed for sending me only; 'For,' says he,
      'my son thinks better of him than of the rest of our whole race.' So this
      important affair was committed to me, with orders to prepare a conveyance
      for you, which I cannot attempt to do; but shall refer myself to your more
      solid judgment in the contrivance of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had sat very attentive to Nasgig, and from what he had declared, could
      not say but there was a very great resemblance between myself and the
      person predicted of. "But then," says I, "they are idolaters: Providence
      would not interpose in this affair, when all the glory of its success must
      redound to an idol. But," says I, "has not the same thing often happened
      from oracular presages, where the glory must redound to the false deity?
      But what if, as is predicted, their religion is to be changed to the old
      ragan's plan, and that will be to the abolition of idolatry? I know not
      what to say; but if I thought my going would gain a single soul to the
      eternal truth, I would not scruple to hazard my life in the attempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      I then called in Youwarkee, told her the whole affair of the prediction,
      which she had often heard, I found, and could have repeated. I told her
      that the king and states had pitched on me as the person intended by their
      prediction, and that Nasgig was sent to fetch me over: "And indeed," says
      I, "Youwee, if this be a true prediction, it seems very applicable to me
      as far as I can see."&mdash;"Yes, truly," says she, "so it does, now I
      consider it in the light you say the ragan puts it."&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," says I, "prophecies and predictions are never so plain as to
      mention names; but yet, upon the solution, they become as intelligible as
      if they did, the circumstances tallying so exactly. But what would you
      have me do? Shall I, or shall I not, go?"&mdash;"Go!" says she, "how can
      you go?"&mdash;"Oh," says I, "never fear that. If this is from above,
      means will soon be found; Providence never directs effects without means."
    </p>
    <p>
      Youwarkee, whose head ran only on the dangers of the undertaking, had a
      violent conflict with herself; the love of me, of her children, and of her
      country, divided her so, she was not capable of advising. I pressed her
      opinion again, when she told me to follow the dictates of my own reason;
      "And but for the dread of losing you, and for my children's sakes," says
      she, "I should have no choice to make when my country is at stake: but you
      know best."
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Youwarkee that I really found the prediction the plainer the more I
      thought of it; and that, above all, the change of religion was the
      uppermost; for if I can reduce a State from the misery and bondage of
      idolatry to a true sense of the Supreme Being, and seemingly by His own
      direction, shall I fear to risk my own life for it? or, will He suffer me
      to perish till somewhat at least is done towards it? And how do I know but
      the whole tendency of my life has been by impulse hither for this very
      purpose? "My dear Youwee," says I, "fear nothing, I will go."
    </p>
    <p>
      I called Nasgig, and told him my resolution, and that he had nothing now
      to do but prepare a means of conveying me.&mdash;He said he begged to
      refer that to me, for my own thoughts would suggest to me both the safest
      and easiest means.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to venture on the back of some strong glumm; when Nasgig told me
      no one could endure my weight so long a flight. But what charmed me most
      was, the lovely Youwarkee offered to carry me herself if she could: "And
      if I can't hold out," says she, "my dear, we can but at last drop both
      together." I kissed the charming creature with tears in my eyes, but
      declined 'the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Nasgig I wanted to divide my weight between two or four glumms,
      which I believed I could easily do; and asked if each could hold out with
      a fourth part of my weight.&mdash;He told me there was no doubt of that;
      but he was afraid I should drop between their graundees, he imagining I
      intended to lie along on their backs, part of me on each of them, or
      should bear so much on them as to prevent their flight. I told him I did
      not purpose to dispose of myself in the manner he presumed, but if two or
      four could undoubtedly bear my weight so long a flight, I would order
      myself without any other inconvenience to my bearers than their burden. He
      made light of my weight between four, as a trifle, and said he would be
      one with all his heart.&mdash;"Nay," says I, "if four cannot hold out, can
      eight?" He plainly told me, as he knew not what I meant, he could say
      nothing to it, nor could imagine how I could divide so small a body as
      mine into eight different weights, for it seemed impossible, he said, to
      him; but if I would show him my method, he would then give me his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then, leaving him, took out my tools: I pitched upon a strong board my
      wife had sent me from the ship, about twelve feet long, and a foot and a
      half broad, upon the middle of which I nailed down one of my chairs; then
      I took one cord of about thirty-four feet long, making handloops at each
      end, and nailed it down in the middle to the under-side of my board, as
      near as I could to the fore-end of it, and I took another cord of the same
      length and make, and this I nailed within three feet of the farther end of
      my board. I then took a cord of about twenty feet long, and nailed about
      three feet before the foremost, and a fourth of the same length, at the
      farther end of my board; by which means the first and third ropes being
      the longest and at such a distance from the short ropes, the glumms who
      held them would fly so much higher and forwarder than the short-rope ones,
      that they and their ropes would be quite out of the others' way, which
      would not have happened if either the ropes had been all of one length, or
      nearer to or farther from one another; and then considering that if I
      should receive a sudden jerk or twitch, I might possibly be shook off my
      chair, I took a smaller rope to tie myself with fast to the chair, and
      then I was sure if I fell into the sea I should at least have the board
      and chair with me, which might possibly buoy me up till the glumms could
      descend to my assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having carried the machine down to the level with the help of two of
      Nasgig's men, he being out on a walk, and having never seen it, I ordered
      one of the men to sit upon the chair, and eight more to hold by the loops
      and rise with him; but, as I found it difficult at their first rising, not
      being able to mount all equally, to carry the board up even, and the back
      part rising first, the front pitched against the ground and threw the
      fellow out of the chair, I therefore bade them stop, and ordering eight
      others to me, said I, "Hold each of you one of these ropes as high as you
      can over your heads; then." says I to the eight bearers, "mount on your
      graundees, and come round behind him in the chair gently, two and two, and
      take each of you a loop, and hover with it till you are all ready, and
      then rise together, keeping your eye on the board that it rises neither
      higher at one end nor one side than the other, and see you all feel your
      weight alike; then fly across the lake and back again." They did so, and
      with as much ease, they told me, as if they had nothing in their hands;
      and the man rode with so much state and composure, he said, that I longed
      to try it myself; so, shifting places with the glumm, I mounted the chair,
      and tying myself round, I asked if any one knew which way Nasgig walked.
      One of them pointing to where he saw him just before in the wood, I
      ordered them to take me up as before, and go that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon coming to the place where I expected Nasgig was, I hallooed and
      called him; who, knowing my voice, ran to the skirt of the wood; and
      seeing me mounted in my flying chair, I jokingly told him I was going, if
      he had any commands; but he mounting immediately came up to me, and
      viewing me round, and seeing the pleasure the men seemed to carry me with,
      says he, "Are you all sure you can carry him safe to Battringdrigg?"&mdash;They
      all replied, "Yes, with ease."&mdash;"This then," says he, "is your doom:
      if you perform it not, every one shall be slit; but if you carry the
      deliverer safe, you are filgays every man of you!" he verily thinking I
      was then going off; but I undeceived him, by ordering them to turn about
      and set me down where I was taken up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig alighting and viewing my contrivance, "This, Peter," says he, "is
      but a very plain thing."&mdash;"It is so," says I, "but it is as far as my
      ingenuity could reach."&mdash;"Ah, Peter!" says he "say not so, for if the
      greatest difficulties, as I and all my nation thought it would be to
      convey you to them, are so plain and easy to you, what must lesser things
      be? No, Peter, I did not call it plain because it might be easily done
      when it was seen, but in respect to the head that formed it; for the
      nearest way to attain one's end is always the best, and attended for the
      most part with fewest inconveniences; and I verily think, Peter, though we
      believe the rise or fall of our State wholly depends on you, you must have
      stayed at Graundevolet but for your own ingenuity. Well, and when shall we
      set out?" says he.&mdash;I told him it would take up some time to settle
      the affairs of my family, and to consider what I had best take with me;
      and required at least three days, being as little as I could have told him
      for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig, who as he was an honest man, and for making the best for his
      patrons, was sorry it was so long, though he, imagining at the same time
      it was short enough for one who was to go on such an enterprise, was glad
      it was no longer; and immediately despatched a trumpet express with
      notice, that on the fourth day he should be at the height of
      Battringdrigg, and that having myself formed a machine for that purpose, I
      would accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began next to consider what part I had to act at Doorpt Svangeanti (for
      I neither could nor would call it by any other name when I came thither),
      and what it was they expected from me. I am, says I, to kill a traitor;
      good, that may be, but then I must take a gun and ammunition; and why not
      some pistols and cutlasses? If I cannot use them all, I can teach others
      who may. I will take several of them, and all my guns but two, and I will
      leave a pair of pistols; I may return and want them. I will take my two
      best suits of clothes, and other things suitable; for if I am to perform
      things according to this prediction, it may be a long time before I get
      back again. Thinks I, Youwarkee shall stay here with the children, and if
      I like my settlement I can send for her at any time. I then began to see
      the necessity of making at least one more machine to carry my goods on.
      And says I, as they will be very weighty, I must have more lasks to shift
      in carrying them, for I will retain sixteen for my own body-machine, in
      order to relieve each other; and as the distance is so great, I will not
      be stinted for want of fresh hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being come to this resolution, I called Nasgig, and ordered eight fresh
      lasks to attend my baggage; these he soon singled out: so, having settled
      all matters with my wife, and taken leave of her and the children, I
      charged them not to stir out of the grotto till I was gone; and leaving
      them all in tears, I set out with a heavy heart for the level, where the
      whole convoy and my two machines waited for me.

      journey&mdash;Is met by the king&mdash;The king sent back, and why&mdash;Peter
      alights in the king's garden&mdash;His audience&mdash;Description of his

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN we came to the
      level, I desired Nasgig to draw all his men into a circle as near as they
      could stand. I then asked them who would undertake to carry me: when not a
      man but proffered his service, and desired to have the post of honour, as
      they called it. I told them my question was only in case of necessity to
      know whom I might depend upon, for my bearers were provided, saving
      accidents. "But, my friends," says I, "as you are equally deserving for
      the offered service, as if you were accepted, are any of you desirous of
      being filgays?" They all answering together, "I, I, I!"&mdash;"Nasgig,"
      says I, "you and I must come to a capitulation before I go, and your
      honour must be pledged for performance of articles."
    </p>
    <p>
      I began with telling them what an enemy I was to slavery: "And," says I to
      Nasgig, "as I am about to undertake what no man upon earth ever did
      before: to quit my country, my family, my every conveniency of life, for I
      know not what, I know not where, and from whence I may never return; I
      must be indulged, if I am ever so fortunate as to arrive safe in your
      country, in the satisfaction of seeing all these my fellow-travellers as
      happy as myself: for which reason I must insist upon every man present
      alighting with me in safety, being made free the moment we touch the
      ground; and unless you will engage your honour for this, I will not stir a
      step farther."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig paused for an answer, for though my bearers were his own lasks, and
      he could dispose of them at pleasure, yet as the rest were the king's, he
      knew not how far he might venture to promise for them; but being desirous
      to get me over the rock, fearing I might still retract my purpose, he
      engaged to procure their freedom of the king. And this, I thought, would
      make the men more zealous in my service.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then permitting them to take me up, we were over the rock as quick as
      thought, and when I had a little experienced the flight, I perceived I had
      nothing to fear; for they were so dexterous on the graundee, that I
      received not the least shock all the way, or scarce a wry position, though
      every quarter of an inch at hand made a considerable deflection from the
      perpendicular. We shifted but twice till we came to Battringdrigg, the
      manner, of which I directed as I sat in my chair; for I ordered the new
      man to hover over him he was to relieve, and reaching down his hand to
      meet the others which were held up with a rope, the old bearer sunk
      beneath the chair, and the reliever took his course. This we did one by
      one, till all were changed; but there was one, a stout young fellow, at
      the first short rope on my right hand, who observing me to eye him more
      than the rest, in a bravado would not be relieved before we arrived at
      Battringdrigg arkoe; and I afterwards took him into my family.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was now somewhat advanced into the light season, I had hopes of a
      tolerable good prospect; but had it been quite light, I should have never
      been the better for it. I had been upon very high mountains in the inland
      parts of Africa, but was never too high to see what was below me before,
      though very much contracted; but here, in the highest of our flight, you
      could not distinguish the globe of the earth but by a sort of mist, for
      every way looked alike to me; then sometimes on a cue given, from an
      inexpressible height my bearers would dart as it were sloping like a
      shooting star, for an incredible distance, almost to the very surface of
      the sea, still keeping me as upright as a Spaniard on my seat. I asked
      them the reason of their so vast descent, when I perceived the labour they
      had afterwards to attain the same height again. They told me they not only
      eased their graundees by that descent, but could fly half as far again in
      a day, as by a direct (they meant horizontal) flight; for though it seemed
      laborious to mount so excessive high, yet they went on at the same time at
      a great rate; but when they came to descend again, there was no comparison
      in their speed. And, on my conscience, I believe they spoke true, for in
      their descents I think no arrow could have reached us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about sixteen hours, for I took my watch with me, we alighted on the
      height of Battringdrigg: when I thought I had returned to my own arkoe, it
      was so like it, but much larger. Here we rested for hours; I opened my
      chest, and gave each of my bearers a drop of brandy. Nasgig and I also
      just wetted our mouths, and ate a piece of preserve to moisten us; the
      rest of the lasks sitting down, and feeding upon what they had brought
      with them in their colapets; for their method is, when they take long
      flights, to carry a number of hard round fruits, flat like my
      cream-cheeses, but much less, which containing a sort of flour they eat
      dry; then drinking, which swells, and fills them as much as a good meal of
      anything else would. Here we met with abundance of delightful pools of
      water on the vast flat of the rocks. They told me, in that arkoe the young
      glumms and gawrys came in vast flights separately, to divert themselves on
      the fine lakes of water, and from thence went sometimes as far as my arkoe
      for that purpose; but that was but seldom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had sufficiently rested, they shut their colapets, which sometimes
      hung down from their necks, and were sometimes swung round to their backs,
      and crossing the arkoe and another large sea, but nothing comparable to
      the first, arrived in about six hours more to the height of the White
      Mountains, which Nasgig told me were the confines of Georigetti's
      territories. But, thinks I, it may belong to whom it will for the value of
      it; for nothing could be more barren than all the top of it was; but the
      inside of it made amends for that, by the prodigious tall and large trees
      it abounded with, full of the strangest kinds of fruits I had ever seen;
      and these trees, most of them, seemed to grow out of the very stone
      itself, not a peck of dirt being to be collected near them. Without-side
      of these mountains, it was scarce darker than at my arkoe; for I made all
      the observation my time would allow me; when spying at a vast distance
      several lights, which were unusual things to me in that country, they told
      me the largest was the burning mountain Alkoe: this I remembered to have
      heard the name of upon some former occasion, though I could not recollect
      what; and that the rest were of the same sort, but smaller. I asked if
      they were in Georigetti's territories. They said no, they belonged to
      another king formerly, whose subjects were as fond of fire as Georigetti's
      were of avoiding it; and that many of them worked with it always before
      them, and made an insufferable noise by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At hearing the above relation, an impression struck my fancy, that they
      might be a sort of smiths or workers in iron, or other metals; and I
      wished myself with them, for I had a mighty notion of that work, having
      been frequently at a neighbouring forge when a boy, and knew all their
      tools, and resolved to get all the information I could of that country
      some other time; for our company drawing to their posts, and preparing to
      set forward again, I could have no more talk now; and you must know, I had
      observed so many idle rascals before I left England, who could neither
      strike a stroke nor stir a foot whilst you talked with them, that I feared
      if I asked questions by the way, they should in answering me neglect their
      duty, and let me drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came near our journey's end, Nasgig asked me where I would please
      to alight I told him I thought at my father's; for though I came on a
      visit to the king, it would not show respect to go before him just off a
      journey. But I might have spared me the trouble of settling that point;
      for we were not gone far from the Black Mountain, it going by that name
      within side, though it is called the White without, before we heard the
      gripsacks, and a sort of squeaking or screaming music, very loud. Nasgig
      told me the king was in flight. I asked him how he knew that, for I could
      see nobody. He knew it, he said, by the gripsack, and the other music,
      which never played but on that occasion; and presently after, I thought
      the whole kingdom were on the graundee, and was going to order my bearers
      back to the mountain, for fear of the concourse. Thinks I, they will
      jostle me down out of civility, and I shall break my neck to gratify their
      curiosity. So I told Nasgig if he did not somehow stop the multitude, I
      would turn back for the mountain, for I would never venture into that
      crowd of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig sprung away to the king and informed him; but the king, fearing the
      people should be disgusted at his sending them back, gave orders for the
      whole body to file off to the right and left, and taking a vast sweep each
      way, to fall in behind me; but upon no account to come near me, for fear
      of mischief. This was no sooner said than done, and all spreading into two
      vast semicircles, met in a train just behind my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig had also persuaded the king to retreat back to the palace, telling
      him it was not with me as with them, who could help themselves in case of
      accident; but as I was under the guidance of others, and on a foundation
      he should scarce, in my condition, have ventured upon, he was sure I
      should be better satisfied with his intended respect only, than to receive
      it there: "But," says he, "that your majesty may see his contrivance, I
      will cause him to alight in the palace garden, where you may have the
      pleasure of viewing him in his machine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king returning, ordered all the colambs, who waited my arrival, to
      assemble in council again; and as I went over the city, I was surprised to
      see all the rock of which it consisted quite covered with people, besides
      prodigious numbers in the air, all shouting out peals of welcome to me;
      and as we were then but little above their heads, every one had something
      to say of me; one wondering what I had got on; another swearing he saw
      hair on my face as long as his arm; and in general, every one calling on
      the Image for my safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was present when I alighted in the garden; and himself taking me
      from my chair, I bent on one knee to kiss his hand; but he took me in his
      arms, called me his father, and told me he hoped I would make his days
      equal in glory to his great ancestor Begsurbeck. We complimented some time
      before he took me into a small refectory in the garden, and gave me some
      of his sort of wine, which I found was loaded with ram's-horn, and some
      dried and moist sweetmeats. He then told me I had a piece of ceremony to
      go through, after which he hoped to have me to himself. I told him,
      whatever forms of State were customary, they become necessary, and I
      should obey him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty then called one of the persons in waiting, and telling him he
      was going to the room of audience, ordered him to conduct me thither
      forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following my guide, after a long walk through a sort of piazza, we entered
      under a stately arch, curiously carved, into a very spacious room, lighted
      with infinite numbers of globe-lamps, where he desired me to sit down on a
      round stone pedestal covered with leaves, and all round the sides were
      running foliages exquisitely wrought; on the walls were carved figures of
      glumms in several actions, but chiefly in battle, or other warlike
      exercises, in alto-relievo, very bold, with other devices interspersed. I
      sat down, having first paid my submission to the throne, and to the
      several colambs who sat on the king's right and left, down the sides of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person then who introduced me, going into the middle of the room,
      spoke to this effect: "Mighty king&mdash;and you honourable lords his
      colambs&mdash;here is present the glumm Peter of Graundevolet; I wait your
      commands where to dispose him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the king and all the colambs arising, another person stepped forth,
      and looking at me, for I was standing, "Glumm Peter of Graundevolet," says
      he, "I am to signify to you that the mighty king Georigetti, and all his
      honourable colambs, congratulate your arrival in Normnbdsgrsutt, and have
      commanded me to give you rank according to your merit." Then the king and
      colambs sat down, and I was led to the king's right hand, and placed on
      the same stone with, but at some small distance from, his majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king then told me the great pleasure I had done him and his colambs,
      in my so speedy arrival upon their message; but said he would give me no
      farther trouble now than to know how I chose to be served; and desired me
      to give orders to a bash he would send to me, for whatever I wanted; and
      then giving orders to a bash to show me my lodgings, I was permitted to
      retire to refresh myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was then conducted to my apartment, up a sloping flight of stone, very
      long, with a vast arch over my head; I believed it might be fifty paces
      long at least, but being a very broad easy ascent, and smooth, it was not
      in the least fatiguing. All the way I went were the same sorts of globe
      lights as in the audience-room. The staircase, if I may call it so, it
      answering the same purpose, was most beautifully carved, both sides and
      top. At length I came into a very large gallery, at least fourscore paces
      long, and about twenty broad; on each side of which hung the same globes.
      At the farther end of this gallery I entered by an arch, very narrow, but
      most neatly wrought, into an oval room; in the middle of this room, on the
      right hand, was another small neat archway; entering through which about
      ten paces, there were two smaller arches to the right and left, and within
      them, with an easy ascent of about three paces, you came to a flat trough
      of stone, six or seven feet long, and about the same width; these, I
      understood by my bash, were the beds to lie on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him if they were used to lie on the bare stone. He told me some
      did, but he had orders to lay me on doffee; and presently up came four
      fellows with great mats, as I took them for by my globe light, full of
      something, which, by their so easily carrying so great bulk, I perceived
      was very light. They pitched it down upon my stone bedstead, and first
      with great sticks, and then with small switches having beat it soundly,
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst I was looking about at the oddity of the place, I found my bash was
      gone too. "So," says I, "all gone! I suppose they intend I shall now go to
      bed." I then went into my bed-chamber, for there were globe lights there
      too, and observing my bed lay full four feet above the stone, and sloping
      higher to the sides and head, I went to feel what it was; but laying my
      hand upon it, it was so soft I could feel no resistance till I had pressed
      it some way; and it lay so light, that a fly must have sunk upon it.&mdash;"Well,"
      thinks I, "what if I never lay thus before, I believe I have lain as bad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I then took a turn into my oval room again, and observed the floor, sides,
      and all was stone, as smooth as possible, but not polished; and the walls
      and ceiling, and in short every place where they could be ornamented, were
      as well adorned with carvings as can be conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though nobody came near me yet, I did not care to be too inquisitive all
      at once, but I longed to know what they burnt in the globes, which gave so
      steady a light, and yet seemed to be enclosed quite round, top and sides,
      without any vent-hole for the smoke to evaporate. Surely, thinks I, they
      are a dullish glass, for they hung almost above my touch, and must be
      exceeding hot with the fire so enclosed, and have some small vent-hole
      though I can't see it. Then standing on tiptoe to feel, it struck quite
      cold to my finger; but I could only reach to touch that, or any of the
      rest, being all of one height.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst I was musing thus, I heard the sound of voices coming along the
      gallery; and presently came a train of servants with as much victuals as a
      hundred men could eat, and wines proportionable; they set it down at the
      upper end of the oval room, on a flat of stone, which on making the room
      had been left in the upper bend of the oval quite across it, about table
      high, for that purpose. These eatables, such as were liquid, or had sauces
      to them, were served up in a sort of grey stone bowls; but the dry were
      brought in neat wooden baskets of twig-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants all retiring into the gallery, except my bash, I asked him if
      anybody was to eat with me: he told me no.&mdash;"I wonder," says I, "they
      should send me so much, then." He replied it was the allowance of my
      apartment by his majesty's orders; which silenced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe there were twenty different things on the table, insomuch that I
      did not know where to begin, and heartily wished for an excuse to get rid
      of my bash, who stood close at my elbow, that I might have smelt and
      tasted before I helped myself to anything, for I knew not what any one
      thing was.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this perplexity, I asked my bash what post he was in under his majesty.
      He said, one of the fifty bashes appointed to be near the king's
      favourites when at court. "And pray," said I, "are you the person to
      attend me?" He was, he said, the principal to wait on my person; but there
      were at least sixty others, who had different offices in this apartment.
      "I would be glad," said I, "to know your name, that I may the more readily
      speak to you." He told me his name was Quilly. "Then, pray, Quilly," says
      I, "do you know what is become of my baggage and chair?" I found, though
      he guessed at my baggage, he was puzzled at the name of chair. "My seat,"
      says I. "Oh, I understand you," says he. "Then, pray, will you go bring me
      word of them, and see them brought safe up into the gallery?" He tripped
      away on my errand. So thinks I, now I am fairly rid of you! but I had
      scarce turned any of my viands over, before I found he had but stepped
      into the gallery, to send some of the idle fellows-in-waiting there. And
      this putting me to a nonplus, "Quilly," says I, "you know I am a stranger
      here; and as different countries have different ways and customs, as well
      of dressing their eatables as other things, and these dishes being dressed
      contrary to my custom, I shall be glad if you will name some of them to
      me, that I may know them when I see them again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quilly began with this, and ran on to that, which was a fine dish; and the
      other few but the king have at their tables. "And here," says he, "is a
      dish of padsi; and there&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold, hold," says I, "Quilly, let's try these first before you proceed;"
      for I remembered, at my grotto, they all eat my fish for padsi, and I cut
      a slice of it; for I always carried my clasp-knife in my pocket, and they
      had no such thing there; and laying it on a round cake I took for my
      trencher, I tasted it, and found it so, to my apprehension, in the palate;
      but it did not look or flake like fish, as I observed by the slices they
      had cut it into; for all the victuals were in long slices ready to bite
      at. I asked him if these things were not all cut, and with what; for I
      understood they had no knives, showing him mine. He said the cook cut it
      with a sharp stone. I then asked him the name of several other things, and
      at last he came to crullmott, which having heard of before, I now tasted,
      and could have sworn it had been a hashed fowl. I asked him if crullmotts
      were very common; he told me yes, towards the bottoms of the mountains
      there were abundance of crullmott-trees.&mdash;"No, no," says I, "not
      trees; I mean fowls, birds."&mdash;"I don't know what they are," said he;
      "but these crullmotts grow on very large trees." Indeed, I did not know
      yet what I was at. "But," says I, "if your fowls do, sure your fish don't
      grow on trees too!"&mdash;"We have none of them," says he, "in this
      country."&mdash;"Why," says I, "it is but this moment I tasted one."&mdash;"I
      don't know," said he, "where the cook got it."&mdash;"Why, here," says I,
      "what you call padsi I call fish."&mdash;"Aye, padsi," says he, "'grows
      upon a bush in the same woods."&mdash;"Well done," says I, "this is the
      first country I was ever in where the fish and fowl grew on trees. It is
      ten to one but I meet with an ox growing on some tree by the tail before I
      leave you."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had by this time, out of these two and some other pickings, made up a
      very good meal; and putting my knife into my pocket, desired something to
      drink. My bash asked me what I pleased to have. I told him, anything to
      take a good draught of. Then he filled me a bott of wine, very well
      tasted, though too sweet for meals; but putting some water to it, it did
      very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      My messengers being returned, and having set all my things in the gallery,
      I desired Quilly to let the victuals be taken away; upon which there came
      more servants than dishes, who took all at once, but some wine and water I
      desired might remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Quilly I saw there were two beds. "Who are they for?" says I.&mdash;"One
      for you and one for me," says he; "for we bashes never leave the king's
      favourites."&mdash;"Pray, Quilly," says I, "what is the meaning that to
      the several rooms I have been in, there is never a door?"&mdash;"Door,"
      says he, "I don't know that."&mdash;"What!" says I, "don't you shut your
      rooms at night?"&mdash;"No, no. Shut at night! I never heard of that."&mdash;"I
      believe," says I, "Quilly, it is almost bed-time; is it not?"&mdash;"No,
      no," says Quilly, "the gripsack has not sounded."&mdash;"How do you know,"
      says I, "in this country, when you shall lie down, and when rise? for my
      wife has told me you have no clocks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; no clocks," says he.&mdash;"Then," says I, "does every one rise and
      lie down when they please? or do you all lie down and all rise together
      about the same time?"&mdash;"Oh," says Quilly, "you will hear the gripsack
      presently. There are several glumms who take it by turns to sound it for
      the rest, and then we know it is time to lie down; and when they sound it
      again, we know it is time to rise." And afterwards I found these people
      guessed the time (being twelve hours between sound and sound) so well,
      that there were but few minutes' variation at any time between them and my
      watch; and I set my watch to go from their soundings at six o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found myself pretty much fatigued after my journey; for though I had
      only to sit still, yet the excessive velocity of such an unusual motion
      strained every muscle as much as the hardest labour; for you may imagine I
      could not at first be without my fears upon ever so small a variation of
      my chair, which, though I could not possibly by my own inclination one way
      or other rectify, yet a natural propensity to a perpendicular station
      involuntarily biasses one to incline this or that way, in order to
      preserve it; and then at first my breath being ready to fail me, in
      proportion to the celerity of the flight, and to my own apprehensions, and
      being upon that exercise near thirty hours, and without sleep for almost
      forty, you may judge I wanted rest; so I told Quilly I would lie down, and
      ordered him not to disturb me till I waked of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not prevent the officiousness of my valet to put me to bed, and
      cover me with the down, or whatever it was; for having no sheets, I pulled
      off nothing but my coat, wig, and shoes, and putting on my flannel
      night-cap, I laid me down.

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The king's apartments described&mdash;Is introduced to the king&mdash;A
      moucheratt called&mdash;His discourse with the king about religion.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> HAVE known some
      travellers so peculiar in their taste as not to be able to sleep in a
      strange lodging. But, thanks to my kind stars, that did not prove my case;
      for having looked on my watch when I went to bed, as I call it, and
      finding it was down, I wound it up, and observed it began to go at about
      three o'clock&mdash;whether day or night, matters not; and when I waked it
      was past nine, so that I know I had slept eighteen hours; and finding that
      a very reasonable refreshment, and myself very hungry, I called Quilly to
      get me my breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quilly told me his majesty had been to visit me, but would not have me
      disturbed. I, begging him to despatch my breakfast as soon as possible,
      and let me have some water for my hands, he ordered the gallery-waiters,
      and everything came immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      My breakfast was a brown liquid, with a sort of seeds or grain in it, very
      sweet and good; but the fear of the king's return before I was ready for
      him, prevented my inquiring into what it was. So, having finished it, and
      washed my hands, Quilly presented me a towel, which looked like an
      unbleached coarse linen, but was very soft and spongy; and I found
      afterwards was made of threads of bark stripped from some tree. I put on
      my brown suit, sword, and long wig, and sent Quilly to know when it was
      his majesty's pleasure I should wait upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been so much used to lamplight in my grotto, that the lights of this
      gloomy mansion did not seem so unusual a thing to me as they would have
      done to a stranger. The king sent me word he would admit me immediately,
      and Quilly was my conductor to his majesty's apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed through the gallery, at the farther end of which was a very
      beautiful arch, even with the staircase, through which Quilly led me into
      a large guard-room, wherein were above a hundred glumms, posted in ranks,
      with their pikes in hand, some headed with sharp-pointed stone, others
      with multangular stone, and others with stone globes. Passing through
      these, we entered another gallery as long as that to my apartment; then
      under another arch we came into a small square room, carved exceeding
      fine; on the right and left of which were two other archways, leading into
      most noble rooms. But we only saw them, passing quite cross the little
      room, through an arch that fronted us into a small gallery of prodigious
      height; at the farther end of which Quilly, turning aside a mat,
      introduced and left me in the most beautiful place in the universe, where,
      neither seeing nor hearing anybody stir, I employed myself in examining
      the magnificence of the place, and could, as I then thought, have feasted
      my eye with variety for a twelvemonth. I paced it over one hundred and
      thirty of my paces long, and ninety-six broad. There were arches in the
      middle of each side, and in the middle of each end; the arch ceiling could
      not be less than the breadth of the room, and covered with the most
      delightful carvings, from whence hung globe-lights innumerable, but
      seemingly without order, which I thought appeared the more beautiful on
      that account. In the centre of the room hung a prodigious cluster of the
      same lights, so disposed as to represent one vast light; and there were
      several rows of the same lights hung round the room, one row above
      another, at proper distances. These lights represented to me the stars,
      with the moon in the middle of them; and after I came to be better
      acquainted with the country, I perceived the lights were to represent the
      southern constellations. The archways were carved with the finest devices
      imaginable, gigantic glumms supporting on each side the pediments.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every ten paces all along the sides and ends, arose columns, each upon
      a broad square base, admirably carved; these reached to the cornice or
      base of the arched ceiling quite round the room. On the panels between
      each column were carved the different battles and most remarkable
      achievements of Begsurbeck himself. Over the arch I entered at, was the
      statue of Begsurbeck, and over the opposite arch the old prophetic ragan.
      In the middle of the room stood a long stone table lengthwise, most
      exquisitely carved, almost the length of the room, except where it was
      divided in the middle about the breadth of the archways, in order for a
      passage from one arch to the other. In short, to describe this one room
      particularly would make a volume of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stayed here a full hour and a half, wondering why nobody came to me; at
      length turning myself about, I saw two glumms coming towards me, and
      having received their compliments, they desired me to walk in to the king.
      We passed through another middling room, and taking up a mat at the
      farther side of it, I was conducted in where his majesty was sitting with
      another glumm. They both arose at my entrance, and calling me their
      father, and leading me, one by each hand, obliged me to sit down between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some compliments about my journey, and accommodation since, the king
      told me I had not waited so long without, but he had some urgent
      despatches to make; and as he chose to have me in private with him, he
      imagined, he said, I would be able to divert myself in the boskee. I
      declared I had never seen anything like it for grandeur and magnificence
      before; but the beauty of the sculpture, and disposition of the lights,
      were most exquisite.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while I felt the other glumm handling my long wig, and feeling
      whether it grew to my head, or what it was; for he had by this time got
      his finger under the caul, and was pulling my hair down; when I turning
      about my head, "Glumm Peter," says the king, "don't be uneasy, the ragan
      will do you no hurt, it is only to satisfy his curiosity; and I chose to
      have the ragan here, that we may more leisurely advise with you what
      course to take in the present exigencies of my State. I have fully heard
      the story of your travels from my colambs, and we have returned thanks to
      the Great Image for bringing you, after so many hazards and deliverances,
      safe to my dominions for our defence."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ragan desired to know whether all that hair (meaning my wig) grew upon
      my head or not. I told him no, it was a covering only, to put on
      occasionally; but that hair did grow on my head, and pulling off my wig I
      showed them. The ragan then asked me if I had hair of my own growing under
      that too (meaning my beard, which he then had in his hand, for their
      glumms have no beards); but I told him that grew there of itself.&mdash;"O
      parly Puly!" says the ragan, rising up, and smiting his hands together,
      "It is he! It is he!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray," says I, "ragan, who is this Puly you speak of?"&mdash;"It is the
      image," says he, "of the great Collwar."&mdash;"Who is that?" says I.&mdash;"Why,
      he that made the world," says he.&mdash;"And, pray," says I, "what did his
      image make?"&mdash;"Oh," says he, "we made the image."&mdash;"And, pray,"
      says I, "can't you break it again?"&mdash;"Yes," says he, "if we had a
      mind to be struck dead, we might; for that would be the immediate
      consequence of such an attempt; nay, of but holding up a finger against it
      in contempt."&mdash;"Pray," says I, "did ever anybody die that way?"&mdash;"No,"
      says he, "no one ever durst presume to do it."&mdash;"Then, perhaps," said
      I, "upon trial, the punishment you speak of might not be the consequence
      of such an attempt. Pray," says I, "what makes Collwar have so great a
      kindness for that image?"&mdash;"Because," says he, "it is his very
      likeness, and he gives him all he asks for us; for we only ask him. Why,"
      says he, "it is the image that has brought you amongst us."
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not then think it a proper time to advance the contrary to the
      person I then had to do with, as I was sure it would have done no good;
      for a priest is only to be convinced by the strongest party: so I deferred
      my argument on that head to a fitter opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most admirable Peter," says the king, "you are the glumm we depend upon
      to fulfil an ancient prediction delivered by a venerable ragan. If you
      will, Ragan I. O. shall repeat it to you, and therein you will be able to
      discern yourself plainly described, in not only similar, but the express
      words I myself, from your story, should describe you in."
    </p>
    <p>
      In good earnest, I had from divers circumstances concluded that I might be
      the person; and resolved, as I thought I had the best handle in the world
      for it from the prediction, to do what I could in the affair of religion,
      by fair means or stratagem (for I was sensible my own single force would
      not do it), before I began to show myself in their cause, or else to
      desert them; and having had a small hint from Nasgig of what the old
      ragan's design was in part, and which I approved of, I purposed to add
      what else was necessary as part of his design, if his proposals had been
      approved of.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told the king I would excuse the ragan the repetition of the prediction,
      as I had partly been informed of it by Nasgig; and that conceiving myself,
      as he did, to be the person predicted of by the ragan, I had the more
      readily set out on this expedition, which nothing but the hopes of
      performing so great a good could have prevailed with me to undertake; and
      I did not doubt, with God's blessing, to accomplish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king grew exceeding joyous at what I said, and told me he would call a
      moucheratt, at which all his colambs should attend, to have their advice,
      and then we would proceed to action; and ordered the ragan to let it be
      for the sixth day, and in the meantime that he and his brethren should,
      day and night, implore the Image to guide their deliberations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ragan being gone, I told the king I had something to impart to him, in
      which it was my duty to obtain his majesty's sentiments before I appeared
      publicly at the moucheratt. He desired me to proceed: I told him I had
      been some time considering the old ragan's prediction, with the occasion
      of it; "and," says I, "it is plain to me that all these mischiefs have
      befallen you for neglect of the ragan's proposal concerning religion; as I
      understand your great ancestor would have come into it, and would have had
      his people done so too, but for the ragans, who hindered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You find," says I, "by your traditional history, that Begsurbeck lived
      long, and reigned gloriously; and I would aim at making you as prosperous
      as he was, and infinitely more happy, not only in outward splendour here,
      but in great glory hereafter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that my discourse had quickened the king's attention, says I,
      "I must let your majesty know it is the old ragan's plan I must proceed
      upon in every branch of it."&mdash;"Why," says the king, "he would have
      abolished our worship of the Image."&mdash;"And so would I," says I; "nay,
      not only would, but must and will, before I engage myself in your
      deliverance; and then, with the only assistance of the great Collwar, whom
      I adore, and whom you must too, if you expect any service from me, I don't
      doubt to prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty sees," says I, "in few words, I have been very plain with
      you; and I desire you, in as concise and plain a manner, to answer me,
      what are your thoughts on this head? for I can say no more till I hear
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king seeing me so peremptory: "Glumm Peter," says he, looking about to
      see no one was near, "I have too much sense to imagine our Image can do
      either good or hurt; for if it could have done us good, why would it not
      in our greatest distress, now near two hundred years past? For my own
      part, I put no trust in it, nor did my famous ancestor the great
      Begsurbeck; but here is my difficulty, where to choose another object of
      worship; for I perceive by myself, mankind must, through natural impulse,
      look to somewhat still above them, as a child does to his father, from
      whom he hopes for and expects succour in his difficulties; and though the
      father be not able to assist him, still he looks to him; and therefore, I
      say, we must have another before we can part with this, or the people,
      instead of the part who have been in the defection, will all desert me;
      for they are easy now in hopes of help from the Image, and every little
      gleam of success is attributed to it; but for the disadvantages we
      receive, the ragans charge them on the people's not praying and paying
      sufficiently; which they, poor souls, knowing in their consciences to be
      true enough, are willing rather, as they are bid, to take the blame upon
      themselves, than to suffer the least to fall on the Image.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this," says the king, "I am sensible of; but should I tell them so,
      my life must pay for it; for the ragans would bring some message from the
      Image against me, to desert or murder me; and then happy would be the
      first man who could begin the mischief, which the rest would soon follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      This so frank and unexpected declaration gave me great confidence in the
      king; and I told him, if that was his opinion, he might leave the rest to
      me. I would so manage it, that the thing should be brought about by my
      means; and I would then satisfy all his scruples, and make him a
      flourishing prince. But I could not help reflecting with myself, how
      nearly this distant prince, and his State, copied some of my neighbours in
      Europe.

      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>

      <i>Peters reflections on what he was to perform&mdash;Settles the method
      of it&mdash;His advice to his son and daughter&mdash;Globe-lights living
      creatures&mdash;Takes Maleck into his service&mdash;Nasgig discovers to

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>AVING now fully
      entered into the spirit of the business with my own good liking, I was
      determined to push it vigorously, or perish in the attempt. "Have I," says
      I, "so large a field before me now to manifest my Maker in to a whole
      nation, and under His own call, and to fulfil their own prediction too;
      and shall I shrink at the possible danger? Or may there not rather be no
      probability of danger in it? The nation is in distress, the readier
      therefore to try any remedy for help: their Image has stood idle two
      hundred years; there has been an old prophecy, or at least if not true, as
      firmly believed to be true as if it was so; and this, in regard to the
      people, answers in all respects as well. But why should it not be true? It
      is better attested by the frequent repetition, from the original delivery
      to this time, than are many traditions I have heard of amongst us
      Christians, which have come out spick and span new from the repositories
      of the learned, of twelve or fifteen hundred years old, little the worse
      for lying by; though they are not pretended to have seen light all that
      time, and are undoubted verities the moment they receive the grand
      sanction. Then if any means but fraud or force can gain so large a
      territory to the truth, and I am the only person can introduce it, shall
      not I endeavour it? Yes, surely; but I am not excluded all advantages
      neither, for all the works of Providence are brought to pass by appointed
      means: and indeed, were it otherwise, what could we call Providence? For a
      peremptory fiat, and it is over, may work a miracle, it is true, but will
      not exhibit the proceedings of Providence. Therefore let me consider, in a
      prudential way, how to proceed to the execution of what I am to set about&mdash;and
      guide me, Providence! I beseech you, to the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the best deliberation I could take, I came to the following
      resolutions: First, to insist on the abolition of the Image-worship, and
      to introduce true religion by the fittest means I could find opportunity
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, as the revolters had been one people with those I would serve,
      and had this prediction amongst them too, and were interested in it, in
      hopes of its distant accomplishment; so if they came properly to the
      knowledge that the person predicted of had appeared, and was ready for
      execution of his purposes, it must stagger their fidelity to their new
      master; and, therefore, I would find means to let them know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, that I would not march till I was in condition not easily to be
      repulsed, for that would break both the hopes and hearts of my party, and
      destroy my religious scheme, and, therefore, I would get some of my
      cannon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly, that I would go to the war in my flying-chair, and train up a
      guard for my person with pistols and cutlasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      These resolutions I kept to myself till the moucheratt was over, to see
      first how matters would turn out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst I waited for the approaching moucheratt, my son Tommy, and daughter
      Hallycarnie, paid their duties to me. It is strange how soon young minds
      are tainted by bad company. I found them both very glad to see me, for
      everybody, they said, told them I was to be their deliverer. They had both
      got the prophecy by heart, and mentioned the Image with all the affection
      of natural subjects. The moment Tommy spoke of it to me, "Hold," says I,
      "young man. What's become of those good principles I took so much pains to
      ground you in? Has all my concern for your salvation been thrown away upon
      you? Are you become a reprobate? What! an apostate from the faith you
      inherited by birthright? Is the God I have so often declared to you a
      wooden one? Answer me, or never see my face more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was extremely confounded to see me look so severe, and hear me
      speak so harsh to him. "Indeed, father," says he, "I did not willingly
      offend, or design to show any particular regard to the Image, for, thanks
      to you, I have none; but what I said was only the common discourse in
      everybody's mouth; I meant neither good nor harm by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tommy," says I, "it is a great fault to run into an error, though in
      company of multitudes; and where a person's principle is sound at bottom,
      and founded upon reason, no numbers ought to shake it. You are young,
      therefore hearken to me; and you, Hallycarnie, whatever you shall see done
      by the people of this country, in the worship of this idol, don't you
      imitate it, don't you join in it. Keep the sound lessons I have preached
      to you in mind; and upon every attempt of the ragans, or any other, to
      draw you aside to their worship, or even to speak or act the least thing
      in praise of this idol, think of me and my words, pay your adoration to
      the Supreme Father of spirits only, and to no wooden, stone, or earthen
      deity whatsoever."
    </p>
    <p>
      The children wept very heartily, and both promised me to remember and to
      do as I had taught them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being now in my oval chamber, and alone with my children, I had a mind to
      be informed of some things I was almost ashamed to ask Quilly. "Tommy,"
      says I, "what sort of fire do they keep in these globes? and what are they
      made of?"&mdash;"Daddy," says he, "yonder is the man shifting them, you
      may go and see." Being very curious to see how he did it, I went to him.
      As I came near him, he seemed to have something all fire on his arm. "What
      has the man got there?" says I. "Only sweecoes," says Tommy. By this time
      I came up to him; "Friend," says I, "what are you about?"&mdash;"Shifting
      the sweecoes, sir," says he, "to feed them."&mdash;"What oil do you feed
      with?" says I.&mdash;"Oil!" says he, "they won't eat oil; that would kill
      them all."&mdash;"Why," says I, "my lamp is fed with oil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy could scarce forbear laughing himself; but for fear the servant
      should do so too, pulled me by the sleeve, and desired me to say no more.
      So turning away with him, "Daddy," says he, "it is not oil that gives this
      light, but sweecoes, a living creature. He has got his basket full, and is
      taking the old ones out to feed them, and putting new ones in. They shift
      them every half day and feed them."&mdash;"What!" says I, "are all these
      infinite number of globes I see living creatures?"&mdash;"No," says he,
      "the globes are only the transparent shell of a bott, like our calibashes.
      The light comes from the sweecoe within."&mdash;"Has that man," says I,
      "got any of them?"&mdash;"Yes," says he, "you may see them. The king and
      the colambs, and indeed every man of note, has a place to breed and feed
      them in."&mdash;"Pray, let us go see them," says I, "for that is a
      curiosity indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy desired the man to show me the swee-coes; so he set down his basket,
      which was a very beautiful resemblance of a common higler's basket, with a
      handle in the middle, and a division under it, with flaps on each side to
      lift up and down. It was made of straw-coloured small twigs, neatly
      compacted, but so light as scarce to be of any weight. Opening one of the
      lids, I could make very little distinction of substances, the bottom
      seeming all over of a white colour. I looking surprised at the light, the
      man took out one, and would have put it into my hand, but perceiving me
      shy of it, he assured me it was one of the most innocent things in the
      world. I then took it, and surveying it, it felt to my touch as smooth and
      cold as a piece of ice. It was about as long as a large lobworm, but much
      thicker. The man seeing me admire the brightness of its colour, told me it
      had done its duty, and was going to be fed, but those which were going
      upon duty were much clearer; and then opening the other lid, those
      appeared far exceeding the others in brightness, and thickness too. I
      asked what he fed them with. He said, "Leaves and fruit; but grass, when
      he could get it, which was not often, they were very fond of."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having dismissed my children, I sent for Nasgig, to gain some
      intelligences I wanted to be informed of. The moment I saw him it came
      into my mind to inquire after my new filgays. He said the king granted my
      request at the first word. I told him then he had saved his honour with
      me, and I was obliged to him. "But," says I, "you told me my bearers
      should be free too."&mdash;"They are so," says he.&mdash;"Then there is
      one thing I want," says I, "and that is to see the second bearer on my
      right hand, who came through without shifting. I have a fancy for that
      fellow," says I, "to be about my person. I like him; and if you can give
      him a good word, I should be glad to treat with him about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend Peter," says he, "you are a man of penetration, though it ill
      becomes me to say so in regard of persons; but I can say that for him, if
      he likes you as well as you seem to like him, he is the trustiest fellow
      in the world; but as he knows his own worth, he would not be so to
      everybody, I can tell you that."&mdash;"I don't fear his disliking me,"
      says I, "for I make it my maxim to do as I would be done by; and if he is
      a man of honour, as you seem to say, he would do the same, and we shall be
      soon agreed."&mdash;"But," says Nasgig, "it being now the fourth day since
      he was freed, he may be gone home perhaps, for he is not of our country,
      but of Mount Alkoe. If Quilly can find him, he will come." So he ordered
      Quilly to send for Maleck of Mount Alkoe, with orders to come to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We descended from one discourse to another, and at length to King
      Georigetti's affairs, when Nas-gig, giving a sigh, "Ah, Peter!" says he,
      "we shall loiter away our time here till the enemy are upon our backs.
      There is venom in the grass; I wish my good master is not betrayed."&mdash;"By
      whom?" says I.&mdash;"By those he little suspects," says he.&mdash;"Why,"
      says I, "they tell me you are much in his favour; if so, why do you suffer
      it?"&mdash;"I believe," says Nasgig, "I am in his favour, and may continue
      in it, if I will join in measures to ruin him, but else I shall soon be
      out of it."&mdash;"You tell me riddles," says I.&mdash;"These things,"
      says he, "a man talks with his head in his teeth. There is danger in them,
      Peter; there is danger!"&mdash;"You don't suspect me," says I, "do you?"&mdash;"No,"
      says he, "I know your soul too well; but there are three persons in these
      dominions who will never let my master rest till out of his throne, or in
      hoximo. I am but lately in favour, but have made as many observations,
      perhaps, as those who have been longer about the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nasgig," says I, "your concern proceeds from an honest heart. Don't
      stifle what you have to say; if I can counsel you with safety, I'll do it;
      if not, I'll tell you so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter," says he, "Georigetti was the only son of a well-beloved father,
      and ascended his throne ten years ago on his decease: but Harlokin, the
      prince of the revolters, whose head is never idle, finding that whispers
      and base stories spread about did not hurt Georigetti, or withdraw his
      subjects' affections, has tried a means to make him undo himself."&mdash;"As
      how?" says I.&mdash;"Why," said he, "by closely playing his game he has
      got one of his relations into the king's service, than whom he could never
      have chosen a fitter instrument. He, by degrees, feeding the king's
      humour, and promising mountains, has pushed into the best places into the
      kingdom. His name is Barbarsa, a most insolent man, who has had the
      assurance to corrupt the king's mistress, and has prevailed and brought
      her over to his interest."&mdash;"Oh perfidy!" says I, "is it possible?"&mdash;"Yes,"
      says he; "and more than that, has drawn in, till now, an honest man called
      Nicor; and it has been agreed between them to protract this war, till by
      their stratagems in procuring the revolt of Gauingrunt, a very large and
      populous province, and now the barrier between us and the rebels, and two
      or three more places, they shall have persuaded Georigetti to fly; and
      then Barbarsa is to be king, and Yaccom-bourse his queen. A union is then
      to be struck between him and Harlokin, and peace made, by restoring some
      of the surrendered provinces; and upon the death of the first of them, or
      their issue, childless, the survivor, or his issue, is to take the whole.
      They laugh at your uniting the dominions, and the old prediction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These," said I, "Nasgig, are serious things, and, as you say, are not
      lightly to be talked of; but, Nasgig, know this, he that conceals them is
      a traitor. Can you prove this?"&mdash;"I have heard them say so," says
      Nasgig.&mdash;"How!" says I, "and not discover it!"&mdash;"I am as anxious
      for that as you can be," says he; "but for me to be cashiered, slit, and
      sent to Crashdoorpt, only for meaning well, without power to perfect my
      good intentions, where will be the benefit to my master or me?"&mdash;"When
      and where did you hear this?" says I.&mdash;"Several and several times,"
      says he, "in my own bed."&mdash;"In your own bed?" says I.&mdash;"I'll
      tell you," says he; "it so happens that when I rest at the palace, as I am
      bound to do when on duty, there is a particular bed for me: now, as the
      whole palace is cut out of one solid rock, though Yaccom-bourse's
      apartment at the entrance is at a prodigious distance from the entrance to
      mine, yet my bed, and one in an inner apartment of hers, stand close
      together; the partition, indeed, is stone, but either from the thinness of
      it, or some flaw in it, I have not yet discovered, I can plainly hear
      every word that is spoken. And there it is, in their hours of dalliance,
      when they use this bed, that I hear what I have now told you."&mdash;"Say
      nothing of it," says I, "but leave the issue to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the messenger returned with Maleck, and he and I soon
      agreeing, I took him into my service.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed as usual, but could get no rest, Nasgig's story engrossing
      my whole attention; I was resolved, however, to be better informed before
      I acquainted the king of it; but rising pretty early next morning, the
      king came into my chamber, leaning upon Barbarsa, to tell me that he had
      received an express that Gauingrunt had revolted. "Peter," says he,
      "behold a distressed monarch; nay, an undone monarch!"&mdash;"Great sir,"
      says Barbarsa, "you afflict yourself too much; here is Mr. Peter come to
      assist you, and he will settle all your concerns, never fear." I eyed the
      man, and (though prejudice may hang an honest person) found him a villain
      in his heart; for even while he was forcing a feeling tone of affliction,
      he was staring at my laced hat and feather that lay on the seat, by which
      I was sure nothing could be at a greater distance than his heart and
      tongue. His sham concern put me within a moment of seizing him in the
      king's presence; but his majesty, at that instant speaking, diverted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the king left me, I told him, having certain propositions to make
      to the moucheratt next day, it was possible they might require time to
      consider them; wherefore it would be proper, at this critical time, to let
      them meet every other day, business or none, till this affair was over.
      The king ordered Barbarsa to see it was so, and then we parted.

    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Hold a moucheratt&mdash;Speeches of ragans and colambs&mdash;Peter
      settles religion&mdash;Informs the king of a plot&mdash;Sends Nasgig to
      the ship for cannon</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>TTENDING at the
      moucheratt to-day, I happened to be seated within two paces of the idol.
      There was the most numerous assembly that had ever been seen; and when all
      was quiet, the king opened with signifying the revolt of Gauingrunt, the
      approach of the enemy, and no forces in the field to stop them. This he
      set forth in terms so moving, that the whole assembly were melted into
      sighs; till one of the colambs rising up, says he: "His majesty has set
      forth the state of his affairs in such a manner, and I am satisfied a true
      one, that it becomes us all to be vigilant. We all seem to have, and I
      believe have, great faith in the remedy this day to be proposed to us, in
      answer to our ancient prediction; and as I doubt not but glumm Peter is
      the man, so I doubt not but through his management we shall still receive
      help; but let us consider if we might not have prevented these pressing
      evils, and especially this last, by speedier preparations against them.
      What province, or member of a State, will not revolt to a numerous host
      just ready to devour them, if they can receive no assistance from their
      head? for, to my certain knowledge, his majesty had ordered this almost a
      year ago, and not a man gone yet. Can we expect Peter to go singly to
      fight an army? Did your prediction say he should go alone? No, he shall
      slay; that is, he and his army; what is done by them being always
      attributed to their general. Inquire, therefore, into your past conduct,
      send Peter, your general, and trust to the Great Image."
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty then said, if there had been any remissness in executing his
      commands, he believed it was done with a view to his service; but a more
      proper opportunity might be found for an inquiry of that nature. As for
      the present moucheratt, it was called solely to propose to Peter the
      execution of the remaining part of the prediction; or, at least, such part
      of it as seems now, or never, to wait its accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here arose a ragan, and told the assembly, in the name of himself and
      brethren, that the prediction had never yet been applicable to any one
      person till glumm Peter arrived; and that his sagacity of itself was a
      sufficient recommendation of him to the guidance of the enterprise; and
      requested that glumm Peter might forthwith be declared protector of the
      army, and set forward with it, that the State might receive safety, and
      the Great Image its proper honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could now hold out no longer; but, standing up, made my speech in the
      following manner, or very near it: "Mighty king&mdash;you, reverend ragans&mdash;and
      honourable colambs&mdash;with the good people of this august assembly&mdash;I
      am come hither, led by the force of your own prediction, at the request of
      his majesty and the states, at the peril of my life, to accomplish things
      said to be predicted of me, glumm Peter. If, then, you have a prediction,
      if, then, your prediction describes me, and the circumstances of these
      times, it consisting of several parts, they ought seriously to be weighed,
      that I may know when and where I am to begin my operation, and when and
      where to leave off; for in predictions the whole is to be accomplished as
      much as any member of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is said I shall destroy the traitor of the ancient limits of your
      monarchy. Are you willing, therefore, that should be done? yea, or nay?"
      Then every one answered, "Yea."&mdash;"And by common consent establish
      what the old ragan would have taught you?" Here the king rose up; but
      Barbarsa giving him a touch (for every one waited to be guided by the
      voice of the ragans), he sat down again; and no one answering Yea, west;
      "I am ready to enter upon it and settle the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      I again put the same question, and told them, as it was their own concern,
      I would have an answer before I proceeded. One of the ragans then rose,
      and said that part of the prediction was too loose to be relied on, for it
      was to settle what he would have taught: "Now, who knows," says he, "what
      he would have taught?" The assembly paused a considerable time, and just
      as I was opening my mouth to speak, an ancient and venerable ragan rose:
      says he, "I am sorry, at my years, to find that truth wants an advocate;
      my age and infirmities might well have excused me from speaking in this
      assembly, so many of my brethren being present, younger and better
      qualified for that purpose than myself; but as we are upon a sacred thing,
      and lest, as I find none of them care to declare the truth, I should also
      be thought to consent to its suppression if I sat silent and suffered it
      to be hid under a quibble, I must beg to be heard a few words. My brother,
      who spoke last, says the words are too loose which say, 'and by common
      consent establish what I would have taught;' but I beg leave to think it
      far otherwise, for we all know what he would have taught, and the memory
      of that hath been as exactly kept as the prediction; for how could our
      ancestors have opposed his doctrine, but from hearing and disapproving it?
      And we all know, not only the prediction, but the doctrine, hath been
      punctually handed down to us; though, woe be to us! we have not proclaimed
      it as we have done the prediction; and let me tell you, when you, my
      brethren, severally come to my years, and have but a single step farther
      to hoximo, you will wish you had taught it, as I do, who believe and
      approve it." The poor old man, having spoke as long as his breath and
      spirits would permit him, sat down, and I again resumed the question, as I
      now thought, on a much better foundation than before, and was immediately
      told by another ragan that there would be no end to the assembly if we
      considered every point at once, for we might next go upon what countries
      we should conquer, and of whom to demand tribute; which would be debating
      about the fruit before the seed was sown. But his opinion was, to go on
      and quell the rebellion, and restore the monarchy, and then go upon the
      other points.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told them, if they had made so light of the prediction as not to declare
      publicly, since they knew it, what the ragan would have taught, it ill
      became me to be more zealous in their own concerns than they were
      themselves; and I should imagine there was very little truth in any part
      of it, and would never hazard my life for their sakes who would not speak
      the truth to save the kingdom, and desired leave of the states for my
      departure; for I was not a person, I told them, to be cajoled into
      anything. I undertook it at first voluntarily; and no man could, or
      should, compel me to it: my life they might take, but my honour they
      should never stain, though I was assured I could easily, with their
      concurrence, complete all that related to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The senior colamb immediately rising, desired me to have a little
      patience, and not to leave the assembly (for I was going out) till I had
      heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is," says he, "this day a thing started, which, I think, every whit
      as much concerns us all, and the body, and every member of the people to
      know, as it does Peter; and I am surprised, unless the present ragans
      believe what their predecessor would have taught to be better than what
      they now teach (for nothing else can make us consent to it), that they
      should scruple to let us know it, and keep us ignorant, who are
      worshippers as well as themselves, of any matter which so nearly concerns
      us to know. I am for obliging the ragans to declare the truth. If this be
      a true prediction, all the relatives to it are true, and I insist that we
      hear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech emboldened several others; and all the populace siding with
      the colambs out of curiosity, cried out to know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving the ragans still hush, I rose; and beckoning the populace to
      silence, "Mighty king&mdash;you, honourable colambs&mdash;and you, good
      people," says I&mdash;"for it is to you I now speak, hear me with
      attention. You think, perhaps, that the suppression of the truth by your
      ragans (charged to their teeth by the most reverend of their whole body,
      whose infirmities rendering him unable, though his will is good, to
      declare this secret to you) will prevent the knowledge of that truth your
      old ragan would have taught, but you are mistaken; and that you may know I
      don't come here at a venture to try if I can relieve you, but with an
      assurance of doing it if you consent, I must let you know from me what the
      ragan would have taught. The ragan would have demolished this trumpery
      piece of dirt, this grimalkin, set out with horrid face and colour to
      fright children; this," I say, "he would have demolished, being assured it
      could neither do good nor hurt, give joy or grief to any man, or serve any
      other purpose whatsoever, but to procure a maintenance to a set of men who
      know much better than they dare to tell you. Can any of you believe this
      stupid piece of earth hears me?" Some of the ragans cried, "Yes!"&mdash;"And
      that he can revenge any affront I shall give him?" Again, "Yes, to be
      sure!"&mdash;"Let him then, if he dare," says I, whipping out my cutlass,
      and with the backside of it striking his head off. "This," says I, "O
      glumms, is what the ragan knew, and what I defy them to deny. Now," says
      I, "I will further show you to whom the old ragan would have taught you to
      make your petitions and pay your adorations; and that is to the Supreme
      Being, Maker of heaven and earth, of us and all things; who provides for
      us meat and drink, and all things, by causing the earth, which He has
      made, to produce things necessary for our use; that Being, whom you have
      heard of by the name of Collwar, and are taught at present to be afraid to
      speak to. And I appeal to your own hearts if many of you have ever thought
      of him. Again," says I, "let anything in the shape of man, that gives
      himself leave to consider at all, only tell me if what he can make, and
      does make, with his own hands, hath not more occasion to depend on him as
      its maker than he on that? Why, then, should not we depend upon and pray
      to our Maker?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You very greatly mistake me, O glumms," says I, "if you imagine I would
      have all those reverend men turned out of employment as useless. No, I
      find they know too much of what is valuable; and therefore those who are
      willing to continue in the service of the mouch, and faithfully to teach
      you the old ragan's doctrine, and such farther lights of the great Being
      as they shall hereafter receive, let them continue your ragans still, and
      let others be chosen and trained up in that doctrine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the poor old man got up again with much difficulty. "Mr. Peter," says
      he, "you are the-man predicted of; you have declared the old ragan's mind,
      and all my brethren know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding I had the populace on my side (for I did not doubt the king and
      the colambs), I put the question to the ragans: "Reverend ragans," says I,
      "you see your prediction this day about to be fulfilled; for if it is a
      true one, no force of man can withstand it. You see your Image disgraced;
      you see, and I appeal to you all for the truth of it, that what the ragan
      would have taught has, without your assistance, been disclosed. I
      therefore would have you the first to break the bondage of idolatry and
      turn to the true Collwar, as it will be so much glory to you. Will you,
      and which of you, from henceforth serve Collwar, and no longer worship an
      idol? Such of you as will do so, let them continue in the mouch: if none
      of you will, it shall be my business to qualify a sufficient number of
      true ragans to form a succession for that purpose. The issue of this great
      affair depends upon your answers." They waited some time for a spokesman
      to begin, and so soon as he was able to get up, the poor old ragan said,
      "I will continue in it, and do all the good I can: and blessed be the day
      this prediction is fulfilled to succeeding generations! I have lived long
      enough to have seen this." Then the rest of the ragans, one by one,
      followed his example. And thus, with prodigious acclamations, both the
      ragans and people ended the great affair of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now more and more believed the truth of the prediction, and told them I
      should have occasion for seven hundred men before I set out against the
      rebels; and desired that they might be commanded by Nasgig. This was
      readily granted. I then told them, as I purposed to act nothing without
      their concurrence, I desired the colambs would remain in the city till I
      set out, that they might be readily called together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then desired I might be quite private from company till I departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took Nasgig home with me; and when we came there, "My dear friend," says
      he, "what have you done to-day! You have crushed a power hitherto
      immovable; and I shall never more think anything too difficult for you to
      attempt."&mdash;"Nasgig," says I, "I am glad it is over. And now," says I,
      "you must enter on a new employ: but first, can you provide me fifty
      honest, faithful glumms for a particular expedition? they must be
      sensible, close, and temporising." He said he would, and come to me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then desired a private audience with the king; who, on seeing me, began
      upon my success at the moucheratt. I told his majesty, if I alone, and a
      stranger, could gain such influence there, I might have had much more if
      he had joined me, especially as he had told me he gave no credit to the
      Image; and that I expected he would have appeared on my side. "Ah, Peter!"
      says he, "monarchs neither see, hear, nor perceive with their own eyes,
      ears, or understandings. I would willingly have done it; but Barbarsa
      prevented me, by assuring me it would be my ruin; and as he is my bosom
      friend, what reproaches must I have suffered if it had gone amiss! Nay, I
      will tell you that he and Nicor are of opinion that your coming hither,
      which is looked upon by us all as such a blessing, will one day undo me;
      'for,' say they, 'though he may perform what you expect from him, it is
      not to be supposed he should suffer it to redound to you.' 'No,' say they,
      'if he can do these great things, he can soon set you aside.' Thus, though
      I have no doubt of you, is my spirit wasting within me through perpetual
      fears and jealousies; and I cannot get these men, who, knowing all my
      secrets, are feared by me, into my own way of thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mighty sir," says I, "don't think I came hither to possess, but redress a
      kingdom. I lived far more to my ease in my grotto than I can in this
      palace; but I now desire you," drawing my sword and putting it into his
      hand, "to pierce this heart's blood and make yourself easy in my death,
      rather than, suffering me to survive, live in distrust of me. No, great
      king," says I, "it is not that I would injure you; but though I have been
      so short a time in your dominions, I find there are those who would, and
      will too, unless you exert the monarch, and shake off those harpies which,
      lying always at your ear, are ever buzzing disquiet and mischief to you."&mdash;"Peter,"
      says he, "what do you mean? sure I have no more traitors in my State!"&mdash;"Your
      majesty has," says I.&mdash;"How can you prove it?" says he. "But pray
      inform me who they are?"&mdash;"I came not hither, great king," says I,
      "to turn informer, but reformer; and so far as that is necessary in order
      to this, I will give you satisfaction. I only desire you will wholly guide
      yourself by my direction for three days, and you shall be able to help
      yourself to all the information you can require without ray telling you.
      In the meantime, appear no more thoughtful than usual, or in any other way
      alter your accustomed habits.".
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig having sent me the fifty men, I asked them if they were to be
      trusted, and if they could carefully and artfully execute a commission I
      had to charge them with. They assuring me they would, I told them I would
      let them into my design, which would be the best instructions I could give
      them, and left the management alone to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      My confidence in them made them twice as diligent as all the particular
      directions in the world would have done; so I only told them I had a mind
      the revolted towns and also the enemy's army should know that the person
      so long ago predicted of was now at Brandleguarp, and had, as the first
      step towards reducing them and killing the traitor Harlokin, already
      altered their religion to the old ragan's plan; and that they had now
      nothing to expect but destruction to themselves as soon as I appeared
      against them with my unknown fire and smoke, which I always had with me;
      and that the thing was looked upon to be as good as done already at
      Brandleguarp; and then to slip away again unperceived. They all promised
      me exact performance, and went off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig then coming in, I told him he was now under my command, and must
      take six hundred glumms with him to Graundevolet; tell Youwarkee to show
      him my ship, and then he must bring me the things I had described to her
      by the name of cannon. He must bring them by ropes, as I was brought; and
      bring powder, which she would direct him to, and the heavy balls which lay
      in the room with the powder. I told him if he thought he should not have
      men enough he must take more; and must be as expeditious as was consistent
      with safety. I desired him to tell Youwarkee I hoped in a short time to
      send for her and all the family over to me. "And now, Nasgig," says I, "my
      orders are finished; but," says I, "the king! I must assist that good man.
      I therefore want to know the particular times Barbarsa and Yaccombourse
      usually meet."&mdash;"That," says he, "is every night when she is not with
      the king; for he is excessively fond of her, and seldom lies without her;
      but whenever he does, Barbarsa is admitted to her."&mdash;"And how can I
      know," says I, "when she will or will not lie with the king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When she is to lie with him," says he, "the king never sups without her."&mdash;"-Now,"
      says I, "you must show me your lodging, that I may find it in your
      absence; and give orders to the guard to let me, and whoever comes with
      me, enter at any time." He then took me to his chamber; but I passed
      through so many rooms, galleries, and passages, that I was sure I should
      never find it again, so I asked him if Maleck knew the way? and he
      assuring me he did, I took my leave of him, and he set out for
      Graundevolet.

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The king hears Barbarsa and Yaccombourse discourse on the plot&mdash;They
      are impeached by Peter at a moucherait&mdash;Condemned and executed&mdash;Nicor
      submits, and is released.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> HAD now several
      important irons in the fire, and all to be struck whilst hot; there was
      the securing religion, sowing sedition amongst the enemy, tripping up the
      heels of two ministers and a she-favourite, and transporting artillery in
      the air some hundred leagues; either of which failing might have been of
      exceeding bad consequence; but as the affair of the ministers now lay next
      at hand, I entered upon that in the following manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king coming to me the next day, as by appointment, and having assured
      me he had hinted nothing to any one, no, not to Barbarsa or Yaccom-bourse,
      told me that Barbarsa had given orders for stopping Nasgig and his men;
      and had persuaded him not to be in such haste in suffering me to do as I
      pleased, but to show his authority and keep me under. Says I, "Your
      majesty's safety is so near my heart, that even want of confidence in me
      shall not make me decline my endeavours to serve you. But have you
      suffered him to stop Nasgig?"&mdash;"No," says he, "Nasgig was gone some
      time before he sent."&mdash;"Oh, sir!" says I, "you do not half know the
      worth of that man! but you shall hereafter, and will reward him
      accordingly. But now, sir," says I, "to what we meet upon; if you will, as
      I told you, but comply with me for three days, without asking questions, I
      will show you the greatest traitors in your dominions, and put them into
      your power too." He promised me again he would. "Then, sir," says I, "you
      must not send to Yaccombourse to sup with you to-night."&mdash;"Nor lie
      with me?"&mdash;"No," says I.&mdash;"Pray, what hurt can arise to my
      affairs from her?" says he.&mdash;"Sir," says I, "you promised me to ask
      no questions."&mdash;"Agreed, agreed!" says he.&mdash;"Then," says I,
      "please to meet me at Nasgig's lodgings without being perceived, if you
      can; at least without notice taken."&mdash;"Good," says he.&mdash;"And
      when you are there, see or hear what you will, you must not say a word
      till you are retired again." All which the king engaging to perform, we
      parted till evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called Maleck, and asked if he knew the way to Nasgig's lodging. He told
      me, very well: and, the time being come, he conducted me thither, where I
      had not waited long before the king came, most of the court being in bed.
      I desired the king to stay in the outer room till I went into the
      bedchamber two or three times, and I thought we must have put it off till
      another night: but listening once again, I found they were come, so I
      called the king, and led him to the place, entreating him, whatever he
      heard, to keep his patience or he would ruin all. We first heard much
      amorous discourse between Barbarsa and Yaccombourse, and then the ensuing
      dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yac</i>. My dearest Barbarsa, what was all that uproar at the
      moucheratt the other day?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bar</i>. Nothing, my love, but that mad fellow Peter, who sets up for a
      conjuror, and wants us all to dance to his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yac</i>. I heard he overcame the ragans at an argument about the Image.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bar</i>. Why, I don't know how that was, but it was the doating old
      ragan did their business; and truly the king's fingers itched to be on
      Peter's side, but I gave him a judicious nod, and you know he durst not
      displease so dear a friend as I am; ha, ha, ha! Am not I a sad fellow, my
      love, to talk so of my king?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yac</i>. He that wants but one step to a throne, is almost a king's
      fellow
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bar</i>. And that but a short one too, my dear Yaccee; but I must get
      rid of that Nasgig, though I think I have almost spoiled him with the
      king, too. I don't love your thinking rascals: that fellow thinks more
      than I do, Yaccee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yac</i>. He'll never think to so good purpose, I believe. But how goes
      cousin Harlokin on? I find Gauingrunt is gone over.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bar</i>. And so shall Bazin, Istell, Pezele, and Ginkatt too, my dear;
      for I am at work there. And then good-night, my poor King Georigetti; thou
      shalt be advised to fly, and I'll keep the throne warm for thee.&mdash;I
      don't see but King Barbarsa and Queen Yaccombourse sound much better than
      Georigetti. Well, my dear, whenever we come to sovereignty, which now
      cannot be long, if Nicor has but played his part well, for I have not had
      an account of his success yet; I say, when we come into power, never let
      us be above minding our own affairs, or suffer ourselves to be led by the
      nose, as this poor insignificant king does. For, in short, he may as well
      be a king of mats, as a king of flesh, if he will not use his faculties,
      but suffer me to make a fool of him thus; and I should be a fool indeed to
      neglect it, when he thinks it the greatest piece of service I can do him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yac</i>. Come, come, my dear! let us enjoy ourselves like king and
      queen till we come to the dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding a pause, the king, who had admirably kept his temper, even beyond
      imagination, stole into the outer room. "Peter," says he, "I thank you;
      you have shown me myself. What fools are we kings! In endeavouring to make
      others happy, how miserable do we make ourselves! How easily are we
      deceived by the designing flattery of those below us!&mdash;Ungrateful
      villain!&mdash;Degenerate strumpet!&mdash;I hate you both.&mdash;Peter,"
      says he, "give me your sword; I'll destroy them both immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold, sir," says I, "your majesty has heard sufficient to found a true
      judgment upon; but kings should not be executioners, or act by passion or
      revenge; but as you would punish that in others, so carefully avoid it
      yourself. You who are in so exalted a station, as always to have it in
      your power to punish a known crime in individuals, have not that necessity
      to prompt you to a violent act that private persons have, to whom it may
      be difficult to obtain justice. Therefore my advice is, that you summon
      the colambs to-morrow, when Barbarsa and Nicor cannot fail to attend; and
      I would also desire Yaccombourse to be there, you having great proposals
      to make to the states which you shall want her to hear. I will in the
      meantime prepare the servants under Quilly, and order Maleck with another
      posse to attend, as by your command, to execute your orders given by me,
      and I myself will impeach those bad persons in public; and Nicor, if he
      will not ingenuously confess what commission he was charged with from
      Barbarsa, shall be put to the torture I direct, till he discovers it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was very well pleased with this method; so I ordered Quilly, as
      from the king, to bring all my servants to the assembly, appointing him
      his place, and Maleck to select me fifty stout persons and to wait to
      execute my orders on a signal given. So soon as the assembly met, I told
      them, since I had concerned myself in their affairs, I had made it my
      business to search into the cause of their calamities; and finding some of
      the traitors were now approached, not only near to, but even into the
      capital city, his majesty had therefore ordered me to ask their advice,
      what punishment was adequate, in their judgments, to the crime of
      conspiring against him and the State, and holding treasonable
      correspondence with his enemies under the show of his greatest friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped, and looked at Barbarsa; he turned as pale as ashes and was
      rising to speak, when the senior colamb declared, if any such thing could
      be made appear, the common punishment of Crash-doorpt was too trivial; but
      they deserved to be dropped alive either to hoximo or Mount Alkoe. The
      several colambs all declaring the same to be their judgment, and even
      those to be too mild for their deserts, I then stepped up to Barbarsa, who
      sat at the king's left hand, as did Yaccombourse at his right, and telling
      them and Nicor they were all prisoners of state, I delivered Barbarsa and
      Yaccombourse in custody to Quilly and his men, and Nicor to Maleck and his
      men, ordering them into separate apartments, with strict commands that
      neither should speak to the other upon pain of the last pronounced
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbarsa would have spoke, and called out to the king, begging him not to
      desert so faithful a servant for the insinuations of so vile a man as
      Peter; but the king only told him the vile man could be made appear
      presently, and he hoped he would meet his deserts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then stood up and told the assembly the whole of what we heard, how it
      first came to be discovered, and that the king himself had been an
      ear-witness of it, which the king confirming, the whole assembly rang with
      confusion, and revenge and indignation appeared in every face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then proposed, as we yet knew not what that secret commission was which
      Nicor was charged with, having enough against the rest, that Nicor might
      be brought forth; and upon refusal to answer, be put to the torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicor appearing before the assembly, I told him I was commanded by the
      king to ask him what commission he was charged with by Barbarsa, and to
      whom. I told him the safest way for his life, his honour, and his country,
      was to make a true confession at first, or I had authority to put him to
      the torture; for, as for slitting and banishment, as they were too slight
      to atone for this offence, he might rest satisfied his would be of another
      sort, if he hesitated at delivering the thing in its full truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My prelude terrifying him, he openly confessed that his last commission
      was to several towns, as from the king, and with his gripsack, to order
      their submission to Harlokin, the king not being in any condition to
      relieve them; and that as soon as they had submitted, Harlokin would be
      let into this city, which could not stand against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also declared that it had been agreed, and the boundaries settled, how
      far Barbarsa, who was to be declared king and marry Yaccombourse, should
      govern, and how far Harlokin; that Barbarsa was to be styled King of the
      East, and Harlokin King of the West; and that either of them, on the
      other's dying childless, was to inherit the whole monarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king declaring this to be all true, and that by my procurement he
      heard it all mentioned but the last night between Barbarsa and
      Yaccombourse as they were solacing themselves in bed, the whole assembly
      ordered them to be brought out, carried with cords about their necks, and
      precipitated into Mount Alkoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then begged they might be suffered to speak for themselves before
      execution; and acquainting them severally with the evidence, I first asked
      Barbarsa what he had to say against his sentence. He declared his
      ambition, and the easiness of his master's temper, had instigated him to
      attempt what had been charged upon him; having, as he thought, a fair
      opportunity of so doing.&mdash;I then asked Yaccombourse the same
      question; she answered me, her ambition had been her sole governor from a
      child, and I had done my worst in preventing the progress of that; and
      whatever else I could do was not worth her notice; "But to have reigned,"
      says she, with some emotion, "was worth the lives of millions, and
      overbalanced everything!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I pleaded hard for Nicor, as I perceived him to be only the favourite's
      favourite, and not in the scrape for his own views, more than what he
      might merit from his new master; and as he had declared the truth, and I
      believed I might make further use of him, I obtained that he might be only
      committed to me, and that I might have liberty of pardoning or slitting as
      I saw fit; and, as I expected, he afterwards proved very useful to me and
      my designs, and I pardoned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the assembly rose, a party of the natives of Mount Alkoe were
      ordered to convey Yaccombourse and Barbarsa to the mountain, slip their
      graundees, and drop them there; and thus ended the lives of these two
      aspiring persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came home, I called Nicor before me. "You know," says I, "Nicor,
      you are obliged to me for this moment of your life; but I don't remind you
      of it for any return I want to myself; but as you are sensible my
      endeavours are to serve this State, I offer you life and freedom upon
      condition you employ your utmost diligence to repair your past conduct, by
      a free declaration of everything in your power that may be for the benefit
      of the kingdom, as you know the springs by which all these bad movements
      have been set at work; and I desire your opinion how best to counteract
      the schemes formed, and redress the evils."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicor being fully convinced of his error, and having lost his patron, was
      very submissive; and declared he believed none of the provinces would have
      gone over to Harlokin, unless they had thought it was the king's order
      Barbarsa had acted by, which, by bearing his gripsack, they made no doubt
      of. He advised to send expresses with the king's gripsack to such places
      as had lately submitted, and to such as were about it, to put a stop to
      them. I told him I had done that; "But not by the gripsack," says he, "and
      unless they see and hear that, they will give no credit to the message."
      He then gave me some particular hints in other affairs of no mean
      consequence; and seeing him truly under concern, and, to my thinking,
      sincere in what he said, I told him I was an absolute enemy to
      confinement, and if any person of repute would engage he should be
      forthcoming upon all occasions that I might have recourse to him, I would
      let him have his liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Nicor, as it commonly happens to great men in disgrace, finding
      himself abandoned by all his friends, after trying everybody, dropping
      some tears, told me next morning he was highly sensible of what a dye his
      offences had been, for that not one amongst all his former friends would
      even look upon him in his present circumstances, wherefore he must submit
      to fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicor having borne a good character before seduced by Barbarsa, and
      knowing that an obliged enemy often becomes the sincerest friend, I
      pressed him again to try his friends. He told me everybody was shy of
      engaging in such an affair; and that he had rather suffer himself, than
      meanly to entreat any one into an unwilling compliance.&mdash;"Come,
      Nicor," says I, "will you be your own security to me? May I take your own
      word?"&mdash;He said he could not expect that; for as the terror of
      slitting lay over him, and in my hands too, he could not answer but he
      might deceive me in case he should conceive I had a design against him;
      which I myself, too, might have from a mistaken motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, Nicor," says I, "you are free; now use your own discretion. I
      think you will never cause my judgment to be impeached for what I have
      done; but if you do, I can't condemn myself for it, and hope I shall have
      no reason to repent it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicor fell at my feet, embraced them, and was so overcome with my
      generosity to him, that I could with difficulty prevail on him to rise
      again; saying he was now more than ever ashamed to see my face. I told him
      I had not done with him, but would use him henceforth as my friend, and
      ordered him to call upon me daily, for I might have several occasions for
      him; and, truly, next to Nasgig, he proved the usefullest man in the
      kingdom.

      criminals go to Crashdoorpt."&mdash;"Are they slit too?" says he.&mdash;"No,"
      says I, "but slipt, I'll assure you. Come, my good friend, I'll let you
      into the history of it." And then I told all that had happened, and the
      king's satisfaction at the judgment of the moucheratt "And now," says I,
      "Nasgig, you may call yourself the favourite, I promise you, for his
      majesty enjoys himself but to greet you on your return: but have a care of
      power; most grow giddy with it, and the next thing to that is a fall."&mdash;"Pray,"
      says he, "what is become of Nicor? Is he under the same condemnation?"&mdash;"No,"
      says I, "Nicor is now by my means absolutely free, and no two greater than
      he and I." I told him then my proceedings with him; he was glad of it;
      for, he said, Nicor he believed was honest at bottom.

    <p>
      By this time up came the cannon; and truly had my countrymen but the
      graundee to convey their cannon at so easy an expense from place to place,
      the whole world would not stand before us. They brought me five cannon,
      and three swivel guns, and a larger quantity of ammunition than I had
      spoken for.
    </p>
    <p>
      I introduced Nasgig to the king upon his return, as the person to whose
      conduct the safe arrival of my cannon was owing. His majesty embracing
      him, told him the service he had done him was so great in the affair of
      Barbarsa, and his management of it so prudent, he should from thenceforth
      take him into his peculiar confidence and esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig thanked his majesty for his acceptance of that act of his duty, and
      desired to know when he pleased the operations for the campaign should
      begin.&mdash;"Ask my father," says the king; "do you conduct the war, and
      let him conduct you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Nasgig desired to know what number of troops would be requisite. I
      asked him what number the enemy had; he said about thirty thousand.&mdash;"Then,"
      says I, "take you six only, besides the bearers of me and the artillery;
      and pick me out fifty of the best men you have, as a guard for my person,
      and send them to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      I showed these men my cutlasses and pistols, and showed them the use and
      management of them: "And," says I, "as our enemies fight with pikes, keep
      you at a distance first, and when you would assault, toss by the pike with
      your hand, and closing in, have at the graundee; and this edge" (showing
      them the sharpness of it) "will strip it down from shoulder to heel; you
      need strike but once for it, but be sure come near enough; or," says I,
      "if you find it difficult to turn aside the pike, give it one smart stroke
      with this; it will cut it in two, and then the point being gone, it will
      be useless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These instructions," says I, "if rightly observed, will make us
      conquerors."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing was to settle the order of my march, which I did in the
      following manner; and, taking leave of the king, I set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, ten companies of one hundred men, including officers, with each a
      gripsack, in ten double lines, fifty abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, four hundred bearers of the cannon, with two hundred to the
      right, the like to the left, as relays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, two hundred men with the ammunition, stores, hatchets, and other
      implements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly, fifty body-guards, in two lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifthly, myself, borne by eight, with twelve on the right, and as many on
      the left, for relays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixthly, two thousand men in columns, on each side the cannon and me,
      fifty in a line, double lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seventhly, one thousand men in the rear, fifty in a line, double lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      I consulted with Nasgig how Harlokin's army lay, that I might avoid the
      revolted towns, rather choosing to take them in my return; for my design
      was to encounter Harlokin first, and I did not doubt, if I conquered him,
      but the towns would surrender of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we arrived within a small flight of his army, I caused a halt at a
      proper place for my cannon, and having pitched them, which I did by
      several flat stones, one on another to a proper elevation, I loaded them,
      and also my small-arms, consisting of six muskets and three brace of
      pistols, and placing my army, two thousand just behind me, two thousand to
      my right, and the same number to my left, I gave a strict command for none
      of them to stir forwards without orders, which Nasgig, who stood just
      behind me, was to give. I then sent a defiance to Harlokin by a gripsack,
      who sent me word he fought for a kingdom, and would accept it; and, as I
      heard afterwards, he was glad I did, for since the intelligence I had
      scattered in his army, they had in great numbers deserted him, and he was
      afraid it would have proved general. I then putting the end of a match
      into a pistol-pan with a little powder, by flashing lighted it; and this I
      put under my chair, for I sat in that, with my muskets three on each side,
      a pistol in my right hand, and five more in my girdle. In this manner I
      waited Harlokin's coming, and in about an hour we saw the van of his army,
      consisting of about five thousand men, who flew in five layers, one over
      another. I had not loaded my cannon with ball, but small-sized stones,
      about sixty in each; and seeing the length of their line, I spread my
      cannons' mouths somewhat wider than their breeches, and then taking my
      observation by a bright star, for there was a clear dawn all round the
      horizon, I observed, as I retired to my chair, how that star answered to
      the elevation of my cannon; and when the foremost ranks, who, not seeing
      my men stir, were approaching almost over me, to fall on them, and had
      come to my pitch, I fired two pieces of my ordnance at once, and so mauled
      them, that there dropped about ninety upon the first discharge, together
      with their commander; the rest being in flight and so close together, not
      being able to turn fast enough to fly, being stopped by those behind them,
      not only hindered those behind from turning about, but clogged up their
      own passage. Seeing them in such a prodigious cluster, I so successfully
      fired two more pieces, that I brought down double the number of the first
      shot; and then giving the word to fall on, my cutlass-guard and the
      pikemen did prodigious execution. But fearing the main body should advance
      before we had got in order again, I commanded them to fall back to their
      former stations, and to let the remainder of the enemy go off.
    </p>
    <p>
      This did me more good in the event than if I had killed twice as many; for
      they not only never returned themselves, but flying some to the right,
      some to the left, and passing by the two wings of their own army,
      consisting of six thousand men each, they severally reported that they
      were all that was left of the whole van of the army; and that the
      prediction would certainly be fulfilled, for that their companions had
      died by fire and smoke. This report struck such terror into each wing,
      that every one shifted for himself, and never appeared more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main battle, consisting of about ten thousand men, knowing nothing of
      what had happened to the wings&mdash;for Harlokin had ordered the wings to
      take a great compass round to enclose us&mdash;hearing we were but a
      handful, advanced boldly; and as I had ordered my men not to mount too
      high, the enemy sunk to their pitch. When they came near, I asked Nasgig
      who led them; if it was Harlokin. He told me no, his general, but that he
      was behind; and Nasgig begging me to let him try his skill with the
      general, I consented, they not being yet come to the pitch of my cannon.
      Nasgig immediately took the graundee, and advancing singly with one of my
      cutlasses in his hand, challenged the general in single combat. He, like a
      man of honour, accepting it, ordered a halt, and to it they went, each
      emulous of glory, and of taking all the advantage he could, so that they
      suddenly did not strike or push; but sometimes one, then the other was
      uppermost, and whirling expeditiously round, met almost breast to breast;
      when the general, who had not a pike, but a pikestaff headed with a large
      stone, gave Nasgig such a stroke on his head that he reeled, and sunk
      considerably, and I began to be in pain for him, the general lowering
      after him. But Nasgig springing forward beneath him, and rising light as
      air behind the general, had gained his height again before the general
      could turn about to discern him, and then plunging forward, and receiving
      a stroke across his left arm, at the same time he gave the general such a
      blow near the outside of the shoulder as slit the graundee almost down to
      his hip, and took away part of the flesh of the left arm, upon which the
      general fell fluttering down in vast pain very near me; but not before
      Nasgig, in his fall, descending, had taken another severe cut at him.

      Immediately upon this defeat Nasgig again took his place behind me, our
      army shouting to the skies; but no sooner had the general dropped, but on
      came Harlokin, with majesty and terror mixed in his looks, and seeming to
      disdain the air he rode on, waved his men to the attack with his hand.
      When he came near enough to hear me, I called him vile traitor, to oppose
      the army of his lawful sovereign, telling him, if he would submit, he
      should be received to mercy. "Base creeping insect," says Harlokin, "if
      thou hast aught to say to me worth hearing, meet me in the air! This hand
      shall show thee soon who'll most want mercy; and though I scorn to stoop
      to thee myself, this messenger shall satisfy the world thou art an
      impostor, and send thee back lifeless to the fond king that sent thee
      hither." With that he hurled a javelin pointed with flint, sharp as a
      needle, at me; but I avoiding it, "This, then," says I, "if words will not
      do, shall justify the truth of our prediction." And then levelling a
      musket at him, I shot him through the very heart, that he fell dead within
      twenty paces of me. But perceiving another to take his room,
      notwithstanding the confusion my musket made amongst them, I ran to my
      match, and giving fire to two more pieces of ordnance at the same time,
      they fell so thick about me, that I had enough to do to escape being
      crushed to death by them; and the living remainder separating, fled quite
      away, and put an end to the war. I waited in the field three days, to see
      if they would make head again; but they were so far from it, that before I
      could return, as I found afterwards, most of the revolting provinces had
      sent their deputies, who themselves carried the first news of the defeat,
      to beg to be received into mercy; all of whom were detained there till my
      return with Harlokin's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my return to Brandleguarp I was met by the king, the colambs, and
      almost the whole body of the people; every man, woman, and child, with two
      sweecoe lights in their hands, which unusual sight in the air gave me
      great alarm, till I inquired of Nasgig what it meant, who told me it must
      certainly be a sweecoan, or he knew not what it was. I asking again what
      he meant by that, he told me it was a particular method of rejoicing he
      had heard of, but never seen; wherein, if the king goes in triumph, all
      the people of Brandleguarp, from fifteen to sixty, are obliged to attend
      him with sweecoes. He said it was reported amongst them that in
      Begsurbeck's time there were two of them, but there had been none since.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we met them, I perceived they had opened into two lines or ranks of a
      prodigious length; at the farther end of which was the king, with
      innumerable lights about him, the whole looking like a prodigious avenue
      or vista of lights, bounded at the farther end, where the king was, with a
      pyramid light. This had the most solemn and magnificent effect on the eye
      that anything of light could possibly have; but as we passed through the
      ranks, each of the spectators having two lights, one was given to each
      soldier of the whole army. And then to look backward, as well as forward,
      the beauty of the scene was inexpressible. We marched all the way amidst
      the shouts of people, and the sounds of the gripsacks, going very slowly
      between the ranks; and at length arriving at the pyramid where the king
      was, I heard abundance of sweet voices, chanting my actions in triumphal
      songs; but I could take little notice of these, or of my son with his
      flageolet amongst them, for the extravagant appearance of the pyramid,
      which seemed to reach the very sky. For, first, there was a long line of a
      full half-mile, which hovered at even height with the two side ranks; in
      the centre of that, and over it, was the king single; over him another
      line, shorter than the first, and again over that, shorter and shorter
      lines; till, at a prodigious height, it ended in one single light *These
      all hovering, kept their stations; while the king darted a little space
      forward to meet me, and congratulate my success; then turning and
      preceding me, the whole pyramid turned, and marched before us, singing all
      the way to the city, the pyramid changing several times into divers forms,
      as into squares, half-moons, with the horns sometimes erect and again
      reversed, and various other figures. And yet amongst this infinite number
      of globes there was not the least glaring or offensive light, but only
      what was agreeable to the people themselves. As the rear of the army
      entered the lines, they closed upon it, and followed us into Brandleguarp.
      While we passed the city to the palace, the whole body of people kept
      hovering till the king and myself were alighted, and then every one
      alighted where he best could. All the streets and avenues to the palace
      were blocked up with people, crowding to receive the king's beneficence;
      for he had proclaimed a feast and open housekeeping to the people for six
      days. The king, the colambs, ragans, and great officers of state, with
      myself, had a magnificent entertainment prepared us in Begsurbeck's great
      room; and his majesty, after supper, being very impatient to know how the
      battle went, I told him the only valorous exploit was performed by my
      friend Nasgig, who opened the way to victory by the slaughter of
      Harlokin's general. Nasgig then rose, desiring only that so much might be
      attributed to him as fortune had accidentally thrown into his scale; for
      it might have been equally his fate as the general's to have fallen. "But
      except that skirmish," says he, "and some flying cuts at the van, we have
      had no engagement at all, nor have we lost a single man; Peter only
      sitting in his chair, and commanding victory. He spake aloud but thrice,
      and whispered once to them, but so powerfully that, having at the two
      first words laid above three hundred of the enemy at their lengths, and
      brought Harlokin to his feet, with a whisper, at the third word he
      concluded the war. The whole time, from the first sight of the enemy to
      their total defeat, took not up more space than one might fairly spend in
      traversing his majesty's garden. In short, sir," says Nasgig, "your
      majesty needs no other defence against public or private enemies, as I can
      see, than Peter; and my profession, whilst he is with us, can be of little
      use to the State."
    </p>
    <p>
      After these compliments from Nasgig, and separate ones from the king and
      the rest, I told them it was the highest felicity to me to be made an
      instrument by the great Collwar in freeing so mighty a kingdom and
      considerable a people from the misery of a tyrannical power. "You live,"
      says I, "so happily under the mild government of Georigetti, that it is
      shocking but to think into what a distressed state you must have fallen
      under the power of a usurper, who, claiming all as his own by way of
      conquest, would have reduced you to a miserable servitude. But," says I,
      "there is, and I am sorry to see it, still amongst you an evil that you
      great ones feel not, and yet it cries for redress. Are we not all, from
      the king to the meanest wretch amongst us, formed with the same members?
      Do we not all breathe the same air? inhabit the same earth? Are we not all
      subject to the same disorders? and do we not all feel pain and oppression
      alike? Have we not all the same senses, the same faculties? and, in short,
      are we not all equally creatures of, and servants to, the same master, the
      great Collwar? Would not the king have been a slave but for the accident
      of being begotten by one who was a king? and would not the poorest
      creature amongst us have been the king had he been so begotten? Did you
      great men, by any superior merit before your births, procure a title to
      the high stations in which you are placed? No, you did not. Therefore give
      me leave to tell you what I would have done. As every man has equal right
      to the protection of Collwar, why, when you have no enemy to distress you,
      will you distress one another? Consider, you great ones, and act upon this
      disinterested principle; do to another, what you, in his place, would have
      him do to you; dismiss your slaves, let all men be what Collwar made them,
      free. But if this unequal distinction amongst you, of man and man, is
      still retained, though you are at present free from the late disaster, it
      shall be succeeded with more, and heavier. And now, that you may know I
      would not have every man a lord, nor every one a beggar, remember I would
      only have every serving-man at liberty to choose his own master, and every
      master his own man; for he that has property and benefits to bestow will
      never want dependants, for the sake of those benefits to serve him, as he
      that has them not must serve for the sake of obtaining them. But then let
      it be done with free-will; he that then serves you will have an interest
      in it, and do it, for his own sake, with a willing mind; and you, who are
      served, will be tenderer and kinder to a good servant, as knowing by a
      contrary usage you shall lose him. I desire this may now be declared to be
      so, or your reasons, if any there are, against it."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the ragans said he thought I spoke what was very just, and would be
      highly acceptable to Collwar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then two of the colambs rose to speak together, and after a short
      compliment who should begin, they both declared they only arose to testify
      their consents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king referring it to me, and the colambs consenting, I ordered freedom
      to be proclaimed through the city; so that every one appeared at their
      usual duties, to serve their own masters for a month, and then to be at
      liberty to come to a fresh agreement with them, or who else they pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, sir," says I to the king, "will now be a day of joy indeed to those
      poor hearts who would have been in no fear of losing before, let who would
      have reigned; for can any man believe a slave cares who is uppermost? he
      is but a slave still. But now," says I, "those who were so before may by
      industry gain property; and then their own interest engages them to defend
      the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is but one thing more I will trouble you with now&mdash;and that,"
      says I to the ragans, "is, that we all meet at the mouch to-morrow, to
      render Collwar thanks for the late, and implore future favour." And this
      passed without any contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we met, the poor ragans were at a great loss for want of their image,
      not knowing what to do or say; for their practice had been to prostrate
      themselves on the ground, making several odd gestures; but whether they
      prayed, or only seemed to do so, no one knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the people were gathering, I called to a ragan, seeing him out of
      character. "Suppose," said I "(for I see you want your image), you and
      your brethren had received a favour of the king, and you was deputed by
      them to thank him, you would scarce be at a loss to express your gratitude
      to him, and tell him how highly you all esteemed his benefits, hoping you
      should retain a just sense of them, and behave yourselves as dutiful
      subjects for the future, and then desire him to keep you still in his
      protection. And this," says I, "as you believe in such a Being as Collwar,
      who understands what you say, you may with equal courage do to Him,
      keeping but your mind intent upon Him, as if you saw Him present."&mdash;"Indeed,"
      says he, "I believe you are right, we may so; but it is a new thing, and
      you must excuse us if we do it not so well at first."
    </p>
    <p>
      I found I had a very apt scholar, for after he had begun, he made a most
      extraordinary prayer in regular order, the people standing very attentive.
      It was not long, but he justly observed the points I hinted to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had done, another and another went on, till we had heard ten of
      them, and in every one something new, and very <i> propos;</i> and
      several of them afterwards confessed they never had the like satisfaction
      in their lives, for they had new hearts and new thoughts, they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spent the sixth-day feast in every gaiety imaginable, and especially of
      dancing, of which they were very fond in their way; but it was not so
      agreeable to me as my own country way, there being too much antic in it.
      New deputies daily arrived from the revolted towns, and several little
      republics, not claimed by Georigetti before, begged to be taken under his
      protection; so that in one week the king saw himself not only released
      from the dread of being driven from his throne, but courted by some,
      submitted to by others, and almost at the summit of glory a sovereign can
      attain to.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE festival being
      over, the colambs begged leave to depart; but the king, who now did
      nothing without me, consulted with me if it was yet proper. I told him, as
      things had so long been in confusion in the west, that though the
      provinces had made their submission, yet the necessity of their
      circumstances, and the general terror, might have caused them only to
      dissemble till their affairs were composed again, and that as it was more
      than probable some relations of the deceased Harlokin, or other popular
      person, might engage them in another revolt, I thought it would not be
      improper to advise with his colambs about the establishment of the present
      tranquillity, and not by too great a security, give way to future
      commotions; and as all the colambs were then present, it might be proper
      to summon them once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were met, the king declared the more particular satisfaction he
      took in that meeting than he had heretofore done, when they had been put
      to it for means to secure their lives and properties: "For now," says he,
      "our deliberations must turn upon securing our new acquisitions, and on
      settling those provinces which, till now, have never fallen under my
      power. But," says he, "I shall refer it to Peter to propose to you what at
      present seems most necessary for you to consider of; and that adjusted,
      shall dismiss you."
    </p>
    <p>
      I told them that as the too sudden healing of wounds in the body natural,
      before the bottom was clean and uncorrupt, made them liable to break out
      again with greater malignity, so wounds in the body political, if skinned
      over only, without probing and cleansing the source and spring from whence
      they arose, would rankle and fret within till a proper opportunity, and
      then burst forth again with redoubled violence. I would therefore propose
      a visitation of the several provinces; an inquiry into their conduct; an
      examination into the lives and principles of the colambs, the inferior
      officers, and magistrates; and either to retain the old, or appoint new,
      as there should be occasion. This visitation I would have performed by his
      majesty&mdash;"and so many of you, the honourable colambs," says I, "as he
      shall see fit should attend him in royal state, that his new subjects may
      see his majesty, and hear his most gracious words; and being sensible of
      his good disposition towards them, may be won, by his equity and justice,
      to a zealous submission to his government, which nothing but the
      perception of their own senses can establish in the heart This, I don't
      doubt, will answer the end I propose, and consolidate the peace and
      happiness of Norm&mdash;Normns&mdash;I must say Doorpt Swangeanti."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing me hesitate at the word Normndbsgrsutt, and call it Doorpt
      Swangeanti, the whole assembly rang with Doorpt Swangeanti! and, at last,
      came to a resolution that the west being now again united to the east, the
      whole dominions should be called Sass Doorpt Swangeanti, or the Great
      Flight Land.
    </p>
    <p>
      They approved the visitation, and all offered to go with the king, but
      insisted I should be of the party, which agreeing to do, I chose me out
      two of the most knowing ragans to teach the new religion amongst them, for
      in every project I had my view to advance religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some were for having the deputies released, and despatched with notice of
      the king's intentions; but I objecting that they might disrelish their
      confinement, and possibly raise reports prejudicial to our proceedings, it
      was thought better to take them with us, and go ourselves as soon as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set out with a prodigious retinue, first to the right, in order to
      sweep round the whole country, and take all the towns in our way, and
      occasionally enter the middle parts, as the towns lay commodious.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were met by the magistrates and chief officers of each district, at
      some distance from each city, with strings about their necks, and the
      crashee instrument borne before them in much humility. His majesty said
      but little to them on the way, but ordered them to precede him to the
      city, and conduct him to the colamb's house; when he was commanded to
      surrender his employment to his majesty, as did all the other officers who
      held posts under him. Then an examination was taken of their lives,
      characters, and behaviour in their stations; and finding most of them had
      behaved well to the government they had lived under (for their plea was,
      they had found things under a usurpation, and being so, that government
      was natural to them, having singly no power to alter it); upon their
      perfect submission to the king, and solemn engagement to advance and
      maintain his right, they received their commissions anew from his
      majesty's own mouth. But where any one had been cruel or oppressive to the
      subjects, or committed any notorious crime, or breach of trust (for the
      meanest persons had liberty to complain), he was rejected, and for the
      most part sent to Crashdoorpt, to prevent the ill effects of his disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      We having displaced but five colambs and a few inferior officers, the
      moderation and justice of our proceedings gave the utmost satisfaction
      both to the magistrates and people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having observed at Brandleguarp abundance of the small images my wife had
      spoken of, and thinking this a proper opportunity to show my resentment
      against them, I ordered several of the ragans of the west before me, and
      asked what small images they had amongst them. One, who spoke for the
      rest, told me, very few, he believed; for he had scarce had any brought to
      him to be blessed. "Where," says I, "is your Great Image?" He told me, "At
      Youk."&mdash;"And have not the people here many small ones?"&mdash;"Very
      few," says he; "for they have not been forced upon us long."&mdash;"How
      forced upon you!" says I; "don't the people worship them?"&mdash;"A small
      number now do," says he.&mdash;"Pray speak out," says I. "When might you
      not worship them?"&mdash;"Never, that I know of," says he, "in our state,
      till about ten years ago, when Harlokin obliged us to it."&mdash;"What!
      did you worship them before?" says I.&mdash;"No," says he, "never since it
      has been a separate kingdom; for we would follow the old ragan's advice of
      worshipping Collwar, which they not admitting of, the State was divided
      between us who would and them who would not come into the ragan's
      doctrine: and though Harlokin was a zealous image-worshipper, yet all he
      could do would not bring the people heartily into it, for Collwar never
      wanted a greater majority." This pleased me prodigiously, being what was
      never hinted to me before; and I resolved not to let my scheme be a loser
      by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were to visit Youk in about eight days, I summoned the ragans and
      people to meet at the mouch; there recounting the great things done by
      Collwar in all nations. "This I could make appear," says I, "by many
      examples; but as you have one even at your own towns, I need go no
      farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must begin in ancient times, when, I presume, you all worshipped an
      idol; have you any tradition before this?"&mdash;They said, "No."&mdash;"This
      image," says I, "was worshipped in Begsurbeck's days, when an old ragan,
      whose mind Collwar had enlightened with the truth, would have withdrawn
      your reverence from the image to the original Collwar himself; you would
      not consent: he threatens you, but promises success to Begsurbeck, who did
      consent; and he had it to an old age. Then those who would also consent,
      were so far encouraged as to be able to form an independent kingdom. Could
      nobody yet see the cause? was it not apparent Collwar was angry with the
      east, that would not follow the old ragan, and cherished the west, who
      would?
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, to be short, let us apply the present instance, and sure it will
      convince us who is right, who wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long as the west followed Collwar, they flourished, and the east
      declined; but no sooner had the west degenerated under the command of
      Harlokin, and the east by my means had embraced Collwar, but the tables
      were turned: the east is found weighty, and the west kicks the beam. These
      things whoso sees not, is blind indeed: therefore let publication be made
      for the destruction of all small images, and let the harbourers of them,
      contrary to this order, be slit; and for myself, I will destroy this
      mother-monster. Take you, holy ragans, care to destroy the brood." And
      having said this, I hacked the new idol to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ordered proclamation for abolishing slavery, under the restrictions used
      at Brandleguarp: and thus having composed the west, and given a general
      satisfaction, we returned, almost the whole west accompanying us, till the
      east received us; and never was so happy a union, or more present to
      testify it, since the creation, I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ordered several of the principal men's sons to court, in order for
      employments, and to furnish our future colambs; and this I did, as knowing
      each country would rather approve of a member of their own body for their
      head than a stranger; and, in my opinion, it is the most natural union.
      And then breeding them under the eye of the king eight or ten years, or
      more, they are, as it were, naturalised to him too, and in better capacity
      to serve both king and country.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my head was constantly at work for the good of this people, I turned
      the most trifling incidents into some use or other; and made the narrowest
      prospects extend to the vastest distances. I shall here instance in one
      only. There was at Youk a private man's son, whom by mere accident I
      happened to ask some slight question of; and he giving me, with a profound
      respect and graceful assurance, a most pertinent answer; that, and the
      manner of its delivery, gave me a pleasure, which upon farther discourse
      with him, was, contrary to custom, very much increased; for I found in him
      an extensive genius, and a desire for my conversation. I desired his
      father to put him under my care, which the old man, as I was then in so
      great repute, readily agreed to; and his son desiring nothing more, I took
      him with me to Brandleguarp. I soon procured him a pretty post but of
      small duty, for I had purposed other employment for him, but of sufficient
      significancy to procure him respect. I took great delight in talking with
      him on different subjects, and observed by his questions upon them, which
      often puzzled me, or his answers to them, he had a most pregnant fancy and
      surprising solidity, joined to a continual and unwearied application. I
      frequently mentioning books, writing, and letters to him, and telling him
      what great things might be attained that way, his inquisitive temper, and
      the schemes he had formed thereon, put me upon thinking of several things
      I should never have hit upon without him. I considered all the ways I
      could contrive to teach him letters; and letting him into my design, he
      asked me how I did to make a letter. I described a pen to him, and told
      him I put a black liquor into it, and as I drew that along upon a flat
      white thing we made use of, called paper, it would make marks which way
      ever I drew it, into what shape I pleased. "Why then," says he, "anything
      that will make a mark upon another thing as I please, will do."&mdash;"True,"
      says I, "but what shall we get that will make a black mark?"&mdash;We were
      entering further into this debate; but the king sending for me, I left him
      unsatisfied. I stayed late with the king that night, so did not see
      Lasmeel (for that was his name) till next night, wondering what was become
      of him. I asked him then where he had been all the day. He told me he had
      been looking for a pen and paper. I laughed, and asked him if he had found
      them.&mdash;"Yes," says he, "or something that will do as well:" so he
      opened one side of his graundee, and showed me a large flat leaf, smooth
      and pulpy, very long and wide, and about a quarter of an inch thick,
      almost like an Indian fig-leaf.&mdash;"And what am I to do with this?"
      says I.&mdash;"To mark it," says he, "and see where you mark."&mdash;"With
      what?" says I.&mdash;"With this," says he, putting his hand again into his
      graundee, and taking out three or four strong sharp prickles. I looked at
      them both; and clapping him on the head, "Lasmeel," says I, "if you and I
      were in England, you should be made a privy-councillor."&mdash;"What!
      won't it do, then?" says he.&mdash;I told him we would try.&mdash;"I
      thought," says he, "it would have done very well; for I marked one all
      about, and though I could not see much at first, by that time I had made
      an end, that I did first was quite of a different colour from the leaf,
      and I could see it as plain as could be." I told him as he was of an age
      to comprehend what I meant, I would take another method with him than with
      a child; so I reasoned from sentences backwards to words, and from them to
      syllables, and so on to letters. I then made one, the vowel A, told him
      its sound, and added a consonant to it, and told him that part of the
      sound of each distinct letter put together, as the two letters themselves
      were, made another sound, which I called a syllable; and that joining two
      or more of them together made a word, by putting the same letters together
      as made the sounds of those syllables which made that word. Then setting
      him a copy of letters, which with very little difficulty were to be drawn
      upon the leaf, and telling him their sounds, I left him to himself; and
      when he had done, though I named them but twice over, his memory was so
      strong as to retain the sounds, as he called them, of every one but F, L,
      and Q.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two months' time I made him master of anything I wrote to him; and as
      he delighted in it, he wrote a great deal himself, so that we kept an
      epistolary correspondence, and he would set down all the common
      occurrences of the day, as what he heard and saw, with his remarks on
      divers things.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as the king and I were walking in the gardens, and talking of the
      customs of my country, and about our wars, telling him how our soldiers
      fought on horseback, the king could not conceive what I meant by a horse.
      I told him my wife had said there were neither beasts nor fishes in the
      country; which I was very much surprised at, considering how we abounded
      with both: "And therefore," says I, "to tell your majesty that a horse is
      a creature with four legs, you must naturally believe it to be somewhat
      like a man with four legs."&mdash;"Why, truly," says he, "I believe it is;
      but has it the graundee?" I could not forbear smiling, even at his
      majesty, and wanted to find some similitude to compare it to, to carry the
      king's mind that way; for else he would sooner, I thought, conceive it
      like a tree or a mountain than what it really was; and as I was musing, it
      came into my head I had given Lasmeel a small print of a horse, which I
      found in one of the captain's pockets at Graundevolet, and believing it to
      be the stamp of a tobacco-paper, had kept it to please the children with;
      so I told the king I believed I could show him the figure of a horse. He
      told me it would much oblige him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing several of the guards waiting at the garden arch, I looked, and at
      last found one of Lasmeel's leaves in the garden, and cutting one of them
      up with my knife, I took the point of that, and wrote to Lasmeel to send
      me by the bearer the picture of a horse I gave him, that I might show it
      the king. And calling one of the guards, "Carry that to Lasmeel," says I;
      "he is, I believe, in my apartment, and bring me an answer directly." Then
      falling into discourse again with the king, and presently turning at the
      end of the walk, I saw the same guard again. Says I "You cannot have
      brought me an answer already."&mdash;"You have not told me," says he,
      "what to bring you an answer to."&mdash;"Nor shall I," says I; "do as you
      are bid;" for I perceived then what the fellow stuck at. He walked off
      with the leaf, but very discontentedly. The king said he wondered how I
      could act such a contradiction. "This, father," says he, "is not what I
      expected from you; to order a man to bring an answer without giving him a
      message." I desired his patience only till the man came back. Presently
      says the king, "Here he comes!&mdash;Well," says he, "what answer?"&mdash;"Sir,"
      says the fellow, "I have only had the walk for my pains: for he sent it
      back again, and a little white thing with it."&mdash;"Ha, ha!" says the
      king, "I thought so.&mdash;Come, father, own you have once been in the
      wrong; for I am sure you intended to give him a message, but having forgot
      it, would not submit to be told of your mistake by a guard." I looked very
      grave, reading what Lasmeel had wrote; which was to tell me he had obeyed
      my orders by sending the horse, for he was just then drawing it out upon a
      leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come," says the king, "give the man his message, father, and let
      him go again."&mdash;"Sir," says I, "there is no need of that, he has
      punctually obeyed me; and Lasmeel was then at the table in my oval chamber
      with a leaf, and this picture in my hand, before him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was ready to sink when I said so, and showed the print. "Truly,
      father," says he, "I have been to blame to question you; for though these
      things are above my comprehension, I am not to think anything beyond your
      skill." I made no reply to it; but showing the king the picture, the guard
      sneaked off; and glad he was, I believe, he could do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went then upon the explanation of my horse, and answering fifty
      questions about him, at last he asked what his inside was: "Exactly the
      same as your majesty's," said I.&mdash;"And can he eat and breathe too?"
      says he.&mdash;"Just as you can," says I.&mdash;"Well," says he, "I would
      never have believed there had been such a creature: what would I give for
      one of them!"&mdash;I set forth the divers other uses we put them to,
      besides the wars; and by the picture, with some supposed alterations, I
      described a cow, a sheep, and numberless other quadrupeds; my account of
      which gave him great pleasure.

      <i>Peter sends for his family&mdash;A rising of former slaves on that
      account&mdash;Takes a view of the city&mdash;Description of it, and of the
      country&mdash;Hot and cold springs.</i>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>AVING now some
      leisure time on my hands to consider over my own affairs, I had thoughts
      of transporting my family, with all my effects, to Sass Doorpt Swangeanti,
      but yet had no mind to relinquish all thought of my ship and cargo; for
      the greatest part of this was still remaining, I having had but the
      pickings through the gulf. I once had a mind to have gone myself; but
      considering the immense distance over sea, though I had once come safe, I
      thought I ought not to tempt Providence, where my presence was not
      absolutely necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig, to whose care and conduct any enterprise might be trusted, offered
      his service to go and execute any commands I should give him. His only
      difficulty, he said, was that it would be impossible for him to remember
      the different names of many things, which he had no idea of, to convey the
      knowledge of them to his mind when he saw them; but barring that, he
      doubted not to give me satisfaction. I told him I would send an assistant
      with him, who could remember whatever I once told him; and that I might
      not burden his memory with names only, Lasmeel should carry his memory
      with him, and that he, Nasgig, should only have the executive part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lasmeel, who had sat waiting an opportunity to put in for a share in the
      adventure, having a longing desire to see the ship, told Nasgig he had a
      peculiar art of memory, so as to remember whatever he would as long as he
      pleased, and that if he carried that with him, they need fear no mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king having granted me as many of his guards as I pleased, for the
      carriage of my things, we appointed them to be ready on the fourth day;
      when Nasgig and Lasmeel set out with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ordered Lasmeel, however, to be with me the next morning, that we might
      set down proper instructions; which I told him would be very long, and
      that he must bring a good number of leaves with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lasmeel entered my chamber next morning, he informed me that the
      whole city was in an uproar, especially those who had been freed by me.
      "What!" says I, "have they so soon forgot their subjection, to misapply
      their liberty already? But step and bring me word what's the matter, and
      order some of the ringleaders hither to me." Lasmeel upon inquiry found
      that it had been given out I was going to leave the country, and they all
      said, wherever I went they were determined to go and settle with me; for
      if I left them, they should be reduced to slavery again. However, he
      brought some of them to me, and upon my telling them I thanked them for
      their affection to me, but blamed them for showing it in so tumultuous a
      manner, and that I was so far from intending to leave them, that I was
      sending for my family and effects in order to settle amongst them, they
      rejoiced very much, and told me they would carry the good news to their
      companions, and disperse immediately. But I was now in more perplexity
      than before, for they having signified my designs to the rest, they rushed
      into the gallery in such numbers that they forced me up to my very
      chamber. I told them this was an unprecedented manner of using a person
      they pretended a kindness for; and told them if they made use of such
      risings to express their gratitude to me, it would be the direct means to
      oblige me to leave them: "For," says I, "do you think I can be safe in a
      kingdom where greater deference is paid to me than to the crown?" They
      begged my pardon, they said, and would obey me in anything; but the
      present trouble was only to offer their services to fetch my family and
      goods, or to do anything else I should want them for; and if I would
      favour them in that, they would retire directly. I told them when I had
      considered of it they should hear from me; and this again quieted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This disturbance not only took up much of my time, which I could have
      better employed, but put me to a non-plus how to come off with them; till
      I sent Maleck to tell them though I set a great value upon their esteem,
      yet after what had passed, it would be the most unadvisable thing in
      nature for me to accept their kindness; for having before requested a body
      of men of the king, as he had graciously granted them, it would be
      preferring them to the king, should I now relinquish his grant and make
      use of their offer; and after this I heard no more of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had scarce met with a more difficult task than to fix exact rules for
      the conduct of my present undertaking, there being so many things to be
      expressed, wherein the least perplexity arising, might have caused both
      delay and damage; for I was not only forced to set down the things I would
      have brought, but the manner and method of packing and securing them; but
      as Lasmeel could read my writing to Pedro at home, and Youwarkee on board,
      it would be a means, though far from an expeditious one, of bringing
      matters into some order; and after I had done as I thought, I could have
      enumerated many more things, and was obliged to add an <i>et ctera</i> to
      the end of my catalogue; and while they were ready for flight, I added
      divers other particulars and circumstances. Nay, when they were even upon
      the graundee, I recollected the most material thing of all; for my
      greatest concern was, having broke up so many of my chests, to find
      package for the things; I say, even so late as that, I bethought me of the
      several great water-casks I had on board, that would hold an infinite
      number of small things, and would be slung easily; so I stopped them and
      set down that, and they were no sooner out of sight and hearing, but
      remembering twenty more, I was then forced to trust them to my <i>et
      ctera</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had sent my own flying-chair to bring the boys who had not the graundee,
      with orders for Pedro to sit tied in the chair, with Dicky tied in his
      arms; Jemmy to sit tied to the board before the chair, and David behind:
      so I hoped they would come safe enough; and then my wife and Sally were
      able to help themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having despatched my caravan, and being all alone, I called Quilly the
      next morning, and telling him I had thoughts of viewing the country, I
      bade him prepare to go with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had now been here above six months, and yet upon coming to walk gravely
      about the city, I found myself as much a stranger to the knowledge of the
      place as if that had been the first day of my arrival, though I had been
      over it several times in my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      This city is not only one of, but actually the most curious piece of work
      in the world, and consists of one immense entire stone of a considerable
      height, and it may be seven miles in length, and near as broad as it is
      long. The streets and habitable part of it are scooped, as it were, out of
      the solid stone, to the level with the rest of the country, very flat and
      smooth at bottom, the rock rising perpendicular from the streets on each
      side.
    </p>

    <p>
      The figure of the city is a direct square; each side about six miles long,
      with a large open circle in the centre of the square, about a mile in
      diameter, and from each of the sides of the outer streets to the opposite
      side runs another street, cutting the centre of the circle as in the
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the whole face of the rock, bounding the streets and the circle,
      there are archways; those in the circle, and the four cross streets, for
      the gentry and better people; and those in the outer streets, for the
      meaner; and it is as easy to know as by a sign where a great man lives, by
      the grandeur of his entrance, and lavish distribution of the pillars,
      carving, and statues about his portico, within and without: for as they
      have no doors, you may look in, and are not forbid entrance; and though it
      should look odd to an English reader, that an Englishman should speak with
      pleasure of a land of darkness, as that almost was, yet I am satisfied
      whoever shall see it after me will be persuaded, that for the real
      grandeur of their entrances, and for the magnificence of the apartments
      and sculpture, no part of the universe can produce the like; and though
      within doors there is no other manner of light than the sweecoes, yet
      that, when you are once used to it, is so agreeable and free from all
      noisome savour, that I never once regretted the loss of the sun within
      doors, though I often have when abroad; but then that would be injurious
      to the proper inhabitants, though they can no more see in total darkness
      than myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been over some of these private houses, which contain, it may be,
      thirty rooms, great and small, some higher, some lower, full of
      sweecoe-lights, and extremely well proportioned and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king's palace, with all the apartments, stands in, and takes up, one
      full fourth part of the square of the whole city; and is, indeed, of
      itself a perfect city.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no great man's house without one or more long galleries for the
      ladies to divert themselves at divers sports in, particularly at one like
      our bowls on a bowling-green, and at somewhat like nine-holes, at which
      they play for wines, and drink a great deal, for none of them will
      intoxicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my walk and survey of the city, one of the colambs being making a house
      to reside in when at Brandleguarp, I had the curiosity to go in. I saw
      there abundance of botts stand filled with a greenish liquor, and asked
      Quilly what that was. He said it was what the stone-men used in making
      houses. I proceeded farther in, where I saw several men at work, and
      stayed a good while to observe them. Each man had a bott of this liquor in
      his left hand, and stood before a large bank of stone, it may be 30 feet
      high, reaching forward up to the ceiling of the place, and ascending by
      steps from bottom to top; the workmen standing some on one step, some on
      another, pouring on this liquor with their left hands, and with their
      right holding a wooden tool, shaped like a little spade. I observed
      wherever they poured on this water, a smoke arose for a little space of
      time, and then the place turned white, which was scraped off like fine
      powder with the spade-handle; and then pouring new liquor, he scraped
      again, working all the while by sweecoe-lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having my watch in my pocket, I measured a spot of a yard long, about a
      foot high, and a foot and a half on the upper flat, to see how long he
      would be fetching down that piece; and he got it away in little above two
      hours. By this means I came to know how they made their houses; for I had
      neither seen any tool I thought proper, nor even iron itself, except my
      own, since I came into the country. Upon inquiry, I found that the
      scrapings of this stone, and a portion of common earth, mixed with a water
      they have, will cement like plaster; and they use it in the small
      ornamental work of their buildings. I then went farther into this house,
      where I saw one making the figure of a glumm by the same method; but it
      standing upright in the solid rock against the wall, the workman held his
      liquor in an open shell, and dipping such stuff as my bed was made of,
      bound up in short rolls, some larger, some less, into the liquor, he
      touched the figure, and then scraped till he had reduced it into a perfect
      piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to imagine how this work rids away; for in ten months'
      time after I saw it, this house was completed, having a great number of
      fine, large, and lofty rooms in it, exquisitely carved to all appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wonder ceased as to the palace, when I saw how easily this work was
      done; but sure there is no other such room in the world as Begsurbeck's,
      that I described above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The palace, as I said before, taking up one quarter of the city, opens
      into four streets by four different arches; and before one of the sides,
      which I call the front, is a large triangle, formed by the entrance out of
      one of the cross streets, and the two ends of the front of the palace.
      Along the lower front of it, all the way runs a piazza of considerable
      height, supported by vast round columns, which seemed to bear up the whole
      front of the rock, over which was a gallery of equal length, with
      balustrades along it, supported with pillars of a yet finer make, and over
      that a pediment with divers figures, and other work, to the top of the
      rock, which being there quite even for its whole length, was enclosed with
      balustrades between pedestals all the way, on which stood the statues of
      their ancient kings, so large as to appear equal to the life. The other
      two sides of the triangle were dwellings for divers officers belonging to
      the palace. Under the middle arch of the piazza was the way into the
      palace, through a long, spacious arched passage, whose farther end opened
      into a large square; on each side of this passage were large staircases,
      if I may so call them, by which you ascend gradually, and without steps,
      into the upper apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning we took another walk, for I told Quilly I had a mind to
      take a prospect of the country. We then went out at the back arch of the
      palace, as we had the day before at one of the sides, there being a like
      passage through the rock from that we went out at, to an opposite arch
      leading into the garden. I say, we went out at the back arch, and after
      passing a large quadrangle with lodgings all round it, we ascended through
      a cut in the rock to a large flat, where we plainly saw the Black Mountain
      with its top in the very sky, the sides of which afforded numberless
      trees, though the ground within view afforded very little verdure, or even
      shrubs. But the most beautiful sight from the rock was to see the people
      come home loaded from the mountain, and from the woods, with, it may be,
      forty pound weight each on their backs; and mounting over the rock, to see
      them dart along the streets to their several dwellings, over the heads of
      thousands of others walking in all parts of the streets, while others were
      flying other ways. It was very pleasant to see a man walking gravely in
      one street, and as quick as thought to see him over the rock, settled in
      another, perhaps two miles distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The near view of the country seeming so barren, naturally led me to ask
      Quilly from whence they got provision for so many people as the city
      contained, which, to be sure, could not be less than three hundred
      thousand. He told me that they had nothing but what came from the Great
      Forest on the skirts of the mountain. "But for the grain of it, and some
      few outward marks," says I, "I could have sworn I had eaten some of my
      country beef the other day at the king's table."&mdash;"I don't know what
      your beef, as you call it, is; but I am sure we have nothing here but the
      fruit of some tree or shrub, that ever I heard of."&mdash;"I wonder," says
      I, "Quilly, how your cooks dress their victuals. I have eaten many things
      boiled, and otherwise dressed hot, but have seen no rivers, or water,
      since I came into this country, except for drinking, or washing my hands,
      and I don't know where that comes from. And another thing," says I,
      "surprises me, though I see no sun as we have to warm the air, you are
      very temperate in the town, and it is seldom cold here; but I neither see
      fire nor smoke."&mdash;"We have," says Quilly, "several very good springs
      under the palace, both of hot water and cold, and I don't know what we
      should do with fires; we see the dread of them sufficiently at Mount
      Alkoe. Our cooks dress their fruits at the hot springs."&mdash;"That is a
      fancy," said I; "they cannot boil them there."&mdash;"I am sure we have no
      other dressing," says he.&mdash;"Well, Quilly," says I, "we will go home
      the way you told me of, and to-morrow you shall show me the springs; but,
      pray, how come you to be so much afraid of Mount Alkoe? I suppose your
      eyes won't bear the light; is not that all?"&mdash;"No, no," says Quilly,
      "that is the country of bad men. Some of us have flown over there
      accidentally, when the mountain has been cool, as it is sometimes for a
      good while together, and have heard such noises as would frighten any
      honest man out of his senses, for there they beat and punish bad men." I
      could not make much of his story, nor did I inquire further, for I had
      before determined, if possible, to get over thither. As we were now come
      into the garden, I ordered Quilly to get ready my dinner, and I would come
      in presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went next morning to view the springs, and indeed it was a sight well
      worth considering. We were in divers offices under the rock (Quilly
      carrying two globe-lights before me), in which were springs of very clear
      water, some of hot, and some of cold, rising within two or three inches of
      the surface of the floor. We then went into the kitchen, which was bigger
      than I ever saw one of our churches, and where were a great number of
      these springs, the hot all boiling full speed day and night, and smoking
      like a caldron, the water rising through very small chinks in the stone
      into basons, some bigger, some less; and they had several deep stone jars
      to set anything to boil in. But what was the most surprising was, you
      should see a spring of very cold water within a few feet of one of hot,
      and they never rise higher or sink lower than they are. I talked with the
      master cook, an ingenious man, about them; and he told me they lie in this
      manner all over the rocky part of the country, and that the first thing
      any one does in looking out for a house, is to see for the water, whether
      both hot and cold may be found within the compass he designs to make use
      of; and finding that, he goes on, or else searches another place. And he
      told me where this convenience was not in great plenty the people did not
      inhabit, which made the towns all so very populous. He said, too, that
      those warm springs made the air more wholesome about the towns than in
      other parts where there were none of them. I thanked him for his
      information, which finished my search for that time.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE days hanging
      heavy on my hands till the arrival of my family, I sent Pendlehamby word
      that as I had sent for my family and effects in order to settle in this
      country, and expected them very soon, I should be glad of his, my brother,
      and sister's company, to welcome them on their arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father came alone, which gave me an opportunity of informing myself in
      the rise and policy of the State, as I purposed to take several farther
      steps in their affairs, if they might prove agreeable and consistent; for
      hitherto, having had only slight sketches or hints of things, I could form
      no just idea of the whole of their laws, customs, and government.
      Explaining myself, therefore, to him, I begged his instructions in those
      particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Son Peter," says my father, "you have already done too much in a short
      time to leave any room to think you can do no more: and as you have
      hitherto directed your own proceedings with such incredible success,
      neither the king nor colambs will interpose against your inclination, but
      give you all the advices in our powers; and I shall esteem your selecting
      me for that purpose no small honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know, then, that this State, by the tradition of our ragans, has
      subsisted eleven thousand years; for, before that time, the great mountain
      Emina, then not far from the Black Mountain, but now fallen and sunk in
      the sea, roaring and raging in its own bowels for many ages, at last burst
      asunder with great violence, and threw up numberless unformed fleshy
      masses to the very stars; two of which happening in their passage to touch
      the side of the Black Mountain (for all the rest fell into the sea and
      were lost) lodged there, and lying close together as they grew, united to
      each other till they were joined in one; and, in process of time, by the
      dews of heaven, became a glumm and a gaw-ry; but being so linked together
      by the adhesion of their flesh, they were obliged both to move which way
      either would. Living thus a long time in great love and fondness for each
      other, they had but one inclination, lest both should be sufferers upon
      the least disagreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In process of time they grew tired of each other's constant society, and
      one willing to go here and the other there, bred perpetual disorders
      between them; for prevention whereof for the future they agreed to cut
      themselves asunder with sharp stones. The pain indeed was intolerable
      during the operation; but, however, they effected it, and the wounds each
      received were very dangerous, and a long time before they were perfectly
      healed; but at length, sometimes agreeing, sometimes not, they begat a
      son, whom they called Perigen, and a daughter they called Philella. These
      two, as they grew up, despising their parents, who lived on the top of the
      mountain, ventured to descend into the plains, and living upon the fruits
      they found there, sheltered themselves in this very rock. Meantime, the
      old glumm and gawry, having lived to a great age, were so infirm that
      neither of them was able to walk for a long time; till one day, being near
      each other, and trying to rise by the assistance of each other, they both
      got up, and leaning upon and supporting each other, they also walked
      commodiously. This mutual assistance kept them in good humour a great
      while, till one day, passing along near hoximo, they both fell in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perigen and Philella had several children in the plains; who, as they
      grew up, increasing, spread into remote parts, and peopled the country. At
      last, one of them being a very passionate man, at the instigation of his
      wife, became the first murderer, by slaying his father. This so enraged
      the people, that the murderer and his wife, in abhorrence of the fact,
      were conveyed to Mount Alkoe, where was then only a very narrow deep pit,
      into which they were both thrown headlong; but the persons who carried
      them thither, had scarce retired from the mouth of the pit, when it burst
      out with fire, raging prodigiously, and has kept burning ever since. Arco
      and Telamine (the murderer and his wife) lived seven thousand years in the
      flames; till having with their teeth wrought a passage through the side of
      the mountain, they begat a new generation about the foot of the mountain;
      and having brought fire with them, resolved to keep it burning ever after
      in memory of their escape; and power being given them over bad men, they
      and their progeny are now wholly employed in beating and tormenting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great while after Arco and Telamine were thus disposed of, the people
      of this country multiplying, it happened one year that all the fruits were
      so dry that the people, not able to live any longer upon the moisture of
      them only, as they had always done before, and fearing all to be consumed
      with drought, one of their ragans praying very much, and promising to make
      an image to Collwar and preserve it for ever, if he would send them but
      moisture, in one night's time the earth cast up such a flood that they
      were forced to mount on the rocks for fear of drowning. But the next day
      it all sunk away again, except several little bubbles which remained in
      many places for a long time, and the people lived only on the moisture
      they sucked from the stone where those bubbles settled for many years; for
      they found that the water arose to the height of the surface, and no
      higher; and where they found most of those chinks and bubbles they settled
      and formed cities, living altogether in holes of the rock; till one
      Lallio, having found out the art of crumbling the rock to dust by a liquor
      he got from the trees, and working himself a noble house in the rock, in
      the place where our palace now stands, he told them if they would make him
      their king, they should each have such a house as his own. To this they
      agreed, and then he discovered the secret to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Lallio directed the cutting out this whole city, divided the people
      into colonies where the waters were most plenty; and while half the people
      worked at the streets and houses, the other half brought them provisions.
      In short, he grew so powerful that no one durst dispute his commands; all
      which authority he transmitted to his successors, who, finding by the
      increase of the people and the many divisions of them that they grew
      insolent and ungovernable, they appointed a colamb in every province, as a
      vice-king, with absolute authority over all causes, except murder and
      treason, which are referred to the king and colambs in moucheratt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As we had no want but of victuals and habitations, the king, when he gave
      a colambat, gave also the lands and the fruits thereof, together with all
      the hot and cold springs, to the colamb, who again distributed parcels to
      the great officers under him, and they part of theirs to the meaner
      officers under them, for their subsistence, with such a number of the
      common people as was necessary in respect to the dignity of the post each
      enjoyed, who for their services are fed by their masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In all cases of war, the king lays before the moucheratt the number of
      his own troops he designs to send; when each colamb's quota being settled
      at such a proportion of the whole, he forthwith sends his number from out
      of his own lasks, and also from the several officers under him; so that
      every man, let the number be ever so great, can be at the rendezvous in a
      very few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have but three professions, besides the ragans and soldiery, amongst
      us, and these are cooks, house-makers, and pike-makers, of which every
      colamb has several among his lasks; and these, upon the new regulations,
      will be the only gainers, as they may work where they please, and
      according to their skill will be their provision; but how the poor
      labourers will be the better for it, I cannot see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear sir," says I, "there are, you see, amongst lasks, some of such
      parts, that it is great pity they should be confined from showing them;
      and my meaning in giving liberty is in order for what is to follow; that
      is, for the introduction of arts amongst you. Now, every man who has
      natural parts will exert them when any art is laid before him; and he will
      find so much delight in making new discoveries that, did no profit attend
      it, the satisfaction of the discovery to a prying genius would compensate
      the pains; but I propose a profit also to the artificer."&mdash;"Why, what
      profit," says my father, "can arise but food, and perhaps a servant of
      their own to provide it for them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," says I, "the man who has nothing to hope loses the use of one of
      his faculties; and if I guess right, and you live ten years longer, you
      shall see this State as much altered as the difference has been between a
      lask and a tree he feeds on. You shall all be possessed of that which will
      bring you fruits from the woods without a lask to fetch it. Those who were
      before your slaves shall then take it as an honour to be employed by you,
      and at the same time shall employ others dependent on them; so as the
      great and small shall be under mutual obligations to each other, and both
      to the truly industrious artificer; and yet every one content only with
      what he merits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear son," says my father, "these will be glorious days indeed! But,
      come, come, you have played a good part already; don't, by attempting what
      you can't master, eclipse the glory so justly due to you."&mdash;"No,
      sir," says I, "nothing shall be attempted by me to my dishonour; for I
      shall ever remember my friend Glanepze. Sir," says I, "see here." (showing
      him my watch).&mdash;"Why, this," says he, "hung by my daughter's side at
      Graundevolet."&mdash;"It did so," says I; "and, pray, what did you take it
      for?"&mdash;"A bott," says he.&mdash;"I thought so," says I; "but as you
      asked no questions, I did not then force the knowledge of it upon you. But
      put it to your ear."&mdash;He did so. "What noise is that?" says he. "Is
      it alive?"&mdash;"No," says I, "it is not; but it is as significant. If I
      ask it what time of the day it is, or how long I have been going from this
      place to that, I look but in its face, and it tells me presently."
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, looking upon it a good while, and perceiving that the minute
      hand had got farther than it was at first, was just dropping it out of his
      hand, had I not caught it. "Why, it is alive," says he; "it moves!"&mdash;"Sir,"
      says I, "if you had dropped it, you had done me an inexpressible injury."&mdash;"Oh
      ho," says he, "I find now how you do your wonders; it is something you
      have shut up here that assists you; it is an evil spirit!" I laughing
      heartily, he was sorry for what he had said, believing he had shown some
      ignorance. "No, sir," says I, "it is no spirit, good or evil, but a
      machine made by some of my countrymen, to measure time with."&mdash;"I
      have heard," says he, "of measuring an abb, or the ground, or a rock; but
      never yet heard of measuring time."&mdash;"Why, sir," says I, "don't you
      say three days hence I will do so; or such a one is three years old? Is
      not that a measuring of time by so many days or years?"&mdash;"Truly,"
      says he, "in one sense I think it is."&mdash;"Now, sir," says I, "how do
      you measure a day?"&mdash;"Why, by rising and lying down," says he.&mdash;"But
      suppose I say I will go now, and come again, and have a particular time in
      my head when I will return, how shall I do to make you know that time?"&mdash;"Why,
      that will be afterwards, another time," says he; "or I can think how long
      it will be."&mdash;"But," says I, "how can you make me know when you think
      it will be?"&mdash;"You must think too," says he.&mdash;"But then," says
      I, "we may deceive each other, by thinking differently. Now this will set
      us to rights:" then I described the figures to him, telling him how many
      parts they divided the day into, and that by looking on it I could tell
      how many of such parts were passed; and that if he went from me, and said
      he would come one, or two, or three parts hence, I should know when to
      expect him. I then showed him the wheels, and explained where the force
      lay, and why it went no faster or slower, as well as I could; and from my
      desire of teaching, insensibly perfected myself more and more in it. So
      that beginning to have a little idea of it, he wished he had one. "And,"
      says he, "will you teach all our people to make such things?"&mdash;"Then
      they would be disregarded, sir," says I.&mdash;"It is impossible," says
      he.&mdash;"I'll tell you, sir, how I mean," said I. "I can, hereafter,
      show you a hundred things as useful as this; now, if everybody was to make
      these, how would other things be made? Besides, if everybody made them,
      nobody would want them; and then what would anybody get by them, besides
      the pleasing their own fancy? But if only twenty men make them in one
      town, all the rest must come to them; and they who make these, must go to
      one of twenty others, who make another thing that these men want, and so
      on; by which means, every man wanting something he does not make, it will
      be the better for every maker of everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Son," says my father, "excuse me; I am really ashamed, now you have
      better informed me, I asked so foolish a question." I told him we had a
      saying in my country, that everything is easy when it is known. "I think,"
      says he, "a man might find everything in your country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after, my wife and daughter Sally came very early; but sure no
      joy could be greater than ours at sight of each other. I embraced them
      both over and over, as did my father, especially Sally, who was a charming
      child. They told me I might expect everything that evening, for they left
      them alighting at the height of Battringdrigg; for though they came out
      the last, yet the body of the people with their baggage could not come so
      fast as they did. And little Sally said, "We stayed and rested ourselves,
      purely, daddy, at Battringdrigg, before the crowd came; but as soon as
      mammy had seen all my brothers safe, who came before the rest, and kissed
      Dicky, we set out again."
    </p>
    <p>
      About seven hours after arrived the second convoy from abroad, that ever
      entered that country. I had too much to do with my wife and children that
      night, to spare a thought to my cargo; so I only set a guard over them;
      for though I had now been married about sixteen years, Youwarkee was ever
      new to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was now obliged to the king again, for some additional conveniences to
      my former apartment; and the young ones were mightily pleased to have so
      much more room than we had at home, and to see the sweecoes; but finding
      themselves waited upon in so elegant a manner, and by so many servants
      (for with our new rooms, we had all the servants belonging to them), they
      thought themselves in a paradise to the grotto, where all we wanted we
      were forced to help ourselves to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Tommy came to see us, the king having given him a very pretty
      post, since the death of Yaccombourse; and Hallycarnie, with the Princess
      Jahamel, her mistress, who was mightily pleased to see Youwarkee in her
      English dress, and invited her and the children to her apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a few months since my wife saw the children; yet she scarce
      knew them, they were so altered; for the two courtiers behaved with so
      much politeness, that their brothers and Sally looked but with an ill eye
      upon them, finding all the fault, and dropping as many little invidious
      expressions on them as possible. But I sharply rebuked them: "We were all
      made chiefly," I told them, "to please our Maker, and that could be done
      only by the goodness of the heart; and if their hearts were more pure,
      they were the best children; but if they liked their brothers' and
      sisters' outward behaviour better than their own, they might so far
      imitate them."
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were settled in our new apartment, I unpacked my chairs and
      tables, and set out my side-board, and made such a figure as had never
      before been seen in that part of the world. I wanted now some shoes for
      Pedro, his own being almost past wear, for the young ones never had worn
      any, but could find none; till applying to Lasmeel, and showing him what I
      wanted, he pointed to one of the great water-casks; but as there were
      eleven of them, big and little, I knew not where to begin; till, having
      invited the king and several of the ministers to dine with me, I was
      forced to look over my goods for several other things I should want.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my search, I found half a ream of paper, a leathern ink-bottle, but no
      ink in it, some quills, and books of accounts, and several other things
      relative to writing. The prize gave me courage to attempt the other casks;
      but I found little more that I immediately wanted. In the last cask were
      several books, two of them romances, six volumes of English plays, two of
      devotion; the next were either Spanish or Portuguese, and the last looked
      like a Bible; but just opening it, and taking it to be of the same
      language, I put them all in again, thinking to divert myself with them
      some other time. I here found some more paper, and so many shoes, as, when
      I had fellowed them, served me as long as I stayed in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having, as I said before, invited the king to eat with me, I was sorry I
      had not ordered my fowls to be brought; and Youwarkee said she thought to
      have done it, but I had not wrote for them. I told her I would send Maleck
      for some of them, I was resolved; for I should pique myself on giving the
      king a dish he had never before tasted. So I called Maleck, telling him he
      must take thirty men with him to Graundevolet: "And carry six empty chests
      with you," says I, "and put eight of my fowls in each chest, and bring
      them with all expedition."&mdash;"Where do they lie, sir?" says he.&mdash;"You
      will find them at roost," says I, "when it is dark."&mdash;"I never was
      there," says he, "and don't know the way."&mdash;"What," says I, "never at
      Graundevolet!"&mdash;"Yes," says he, "but not at roost."&mdash;I laughed,
      saying, "Maleck, did not you see fowls when you was there?" He said he did
      not know; what were they like?&mdash;"They are a bird," says I.&mdash;"And
      what sort of a thing is that?" says he. Youwee hearing us in this debate,
      "Maleck," says she, "did not you see me toss down little nuts to something
      that you stared at? you saw them eat the nuts."&mdash;"Oh dear," says he,
      "I know it very well, with two legs and no arms."&mdash;"The same," says
      I, "Maleck; do you go look for a little house, almost by my grotto, and at
      night you will find these things stand on sticks in that house. Take them
      down gently, and come away with them in the chests." Maleck performed his
      business to a hair; but instead of forty-eight, brought me sixty, telling
      me he found the chests would hold them very well; and I kept them
      afterwards in the king's garden.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>O further project
      being ripe for execution, I took a journey home with my father to
      Arndrumnstake, and he would take all the children with him. Youwarkee and
      I stayed about six weeks, leaving all the children with my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon my return, I frequently talked with Maleck about his country; who
      they originally were, and how long it had been inhabited, and what other
      countries bordered thereon, and how they lay. He told me his countrymen
      looked upon themselves to be very ancient, but they were not very
      numerous; for the old stock was almost worn out by the hardships they had
      undergone; that about three hundred years before, he said, as he had it
      from good report, there were a people from beyond the sea, or, as they
      called themselves, from the Little Lands, had strangely overrun them; and
      he had heard say they would have overrun this country too, but they
      thought it would not answer. He said, "when those people first came, they
      began to turn up the earth to a prodigious depth; and now," says he,
      "bringing some nasty hard earth of several sorts, they put it into great
      fires till it runs about like water, and then beat it about with great
      heavy things into several shapes; and some of it, sir," says he, "looks
      just like that stuff that lay at the bottom of your ship, and some almost
      white, and some red; for when I was a boy I was to have been sent to work
      amongst them, as my father did; but it having killed him, I came hither,
      as many more have done, to avoid it."&mdash;"And what do they do with it,"
      says I, "when they have beat it about as you say?"&mdash;"Then," says he,
      "they carry it a long way to the sea."&mdash;"What then?" says I.&mdash;"Why,
      then the Little-landers take it, and swim over the sea with it."&mdash;"And
      what do they do with it?" says I.&mdash;"Why," says he, "there are other
      people who take it from them, and go away with it."&mdash;"Why do they let
      them take it?" says I.&mdash;"Because," says he, "they give them clothes
      for it."&mdash;"Do they want clothes," says I, "more than you?" He told me
      they had no graundee.&mdash;"And what other countries have you hereabout?"&mdash;
      "There is one country," says he, "north of Alkoe, where they say there is
      just such another people as the Little-landers, and they get some of the
      things from Mount Alkoe."&mdash;"What do they do with them?" says I.&mdash;"I
      don't know," says he; "they fetch a great deal; but they won't let anybody
      come into their country."&mdash;"Is there nobody inhabits between the
      Mountain Alkoe and the sea?" He told me no, the Little-landers would not
      let them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having got what information I could from Maleck, and also from a
      countryman or two of his he had brought to me, I considered it all over;
      And, thinks I, if I could but get Mount Alkoe to submit (for they had told
      me they were only governed by a deputy from the Little Lands) to see the
      work done, I might, by intercepting the trade to the sea, turn the profit
      of the country my own way, and make it pass through our hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I next inquired of those who brought the fruits from the Great Forest,
      what sort of land they had there, and found, by their description, it was
      a light mould, and in many places well covered with grass and herbs; and
      by all the report I could hear, must be a fruitful country, well managed;
      and being a flat country and not encompassed on that side with the Black
      Mountain, was much higher than Doorpt Swangeanti. This news put me upon
      searching the truth of it; and I made the tour of the Black Mountain and
      the Great Forest, alighting often to make my observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forest is a little world of wood without end, with here and there a
      fine lawn very grassy; and indeed the wood-grounds bear it very well, the
      trees not standing in crowds, but at a healthy distance from each other. I
      went abundantly farther than any one had before been, but saw no variation
      in the woody scene; and coming round westward home, I had a view of
      hoximo; which is nothing but a narrow cleft in the earth, on the top of
      the Black Mountain, of a most extraordinary depth; for upon dropping a
      stone down, you shall hear it strike and hum for a long time before all is
      quiet again; and laying my ear over the cleft, whilst I ordered one of my
      attendants to throw a large stone down, after the usual thumps and
      humming, I imagined I heard it dash in water, so that it is not impossible
      it may reach to the sea; which is at least six or seven miles below it.
      Into this hole all dead bodies are precipitated, from the king to the
      beggar; for four glumms holding by the ankles and wrists of the deceased,
      fly with them to hoximo and throw them down, whilst the air is filled with
      the lamentations of the relations of the deceased, and of such others as
      are induced to follow the corpse for the sake of the wines, on such
      occasions plentifully distributed to all comers by the gentry, and in the
      best proportion they are able by even the meanest amongst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a stay of about fourteen days at home, I fixed my next trip for
      Mount Alkoe; and having told Maleck my design, he said he would go with me
      with all his heart, but feared I should get no Brandleguarpine to bear me;
      for he told me they had an old tradition that Mindrack lived there, and
      would not go for all the world; which has been the greatest security that
      country has had, for this would have devoured them else, says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke to the king, to Nasgig, and the ragans, and found them all
      unanimous that the mountain Alkoe was the habitation of Mindrack, and that
      the noises which had been heard there were his servants beating bad men.
      Says I to myself, Here is one of the usefullest projects upon earth
      spoiled by an unaccountable prepossession; what must be done to overcome
      this prejudice?
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Maleck I found what he said to be too true, as to the people of
      Brandleguarp: "But," says I, "are there not enough of your countrymen here
      to carry me thither?" He believing there were, I ordered him to contract
      with them; but it vexed me very much to be obliged to take these men.
      However, though I resolved to go, yet I chose to reason the ragans into
      the project if I could; thinking they would soon bring the people over.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called several of the ragans together, and said: "Because you are a
      wiser and more thinking people than the vulgar, I have applied myself to
      your judgments in the affair of Mount Alkoe. Now, consider with yourselves
      whether you have any real reason beyond a prepossession, for thinking
      these people fiends, or devil's servants, as you call them, without
      further examination; for according to my comprehension, they only,
      understanding the nature of several sorts of earth, reduce them by labour
      and fire to solid substances for the use of mankind; and the want of these
      things is the reason of your living as you do, without a hundredth part of
      the benefits of life. These sort of people, these noises and these
      operations, which you hear and see carried on at Alkoe, are to be heard
      and seen in my country; and we deal and traffic with their labours, from
      one end of the world to the other; and we who are with them the happiest,
      without them should be the most miserable of people. Did not some of you
      see, at my entertainment, what I called my knives and forks and spoons, my
      pistols, cutlasses, and silver cup? All these, and infinitely more, are
      the produce of these poor men's industry. Now," says I, "if we settle a
      communication with these people, your dues will be all paid in these
      curious things; you will have your people employed in working them, and
      have strangers applying to you to serve them with what they want; who in
      return will give you what you want; and you will find yourselves known and
      respected in the world." Finding some of these arguments applied to the
      men had staggered them a little, I applied to their senses. Says I, "It
      still appears to me that you have your prejudices hanging on you; but what
      will you say if I go thither and return safe? will you be afraid to follow
      me another time?" They persuaded me from it, as a dangerous experiment;
      but said, if I did return, they would not think there was so much in it as
      they suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maleck having chose me out fourscore of his countrymen, in about a month's
      time I trained them up to the knowledge of my pistols and cutlasses, and
      the management of them; and taking a chest with me for the arms and other
      necessaries, we sallied up to the Black Mountain. I rested there; and
      there Nasgig and Lasmeel overtook me, saying that when they found me
      obstinate to go, they could not in their hearts leave me, happen what
      would. This put new spirits into me, and we consulted how the noises lay,
      and agreed to engage first upon the skirts of them, where the smokes were
      most straggling. I charged six guns and all my pistols, which I kept in my
      chest, and ordered them to alight with me about a hundred paces from the
      first smoke they saw; then ordered three of them to carry my guns after
      me, and twelve of them to take pistols and follow me; but not to fire till
      I gave orders. The remainder I left with the baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      We marched up to the smoke, which issued out of a low archway just at the
      foot of the mountain. It was very light there with the flames of the
      volcano; and entering the arch, a fellow ran at me with a red-hot iron
      bar; him I shot dead: and seeing two more and a woman there, who stood
      with their faces to the wall of the hut or room, as unwilling to be seen,
      I ordered Maleck to speak to them in a known tongue, and tell them we were
      no enemies, nor intended them any hurt; and that their companion's fate
      was owing to his own rashness in running first at me with the hot bar; and
      that if they would show themselves good-natured and civil to us, we should
      be so to them; but if they offered to resist openly, or use any manner of
      treachery towards us, they might depend upon the same fate their companion
      had just suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon hearing this, they approached us; and showing great tokens of
      submission, I delivered my gun to Maleck, and bade them go on with their
      work, ordering all the guns out of the shop for fear of a spark. I then
      perceived they were direct forges, but made after another manner from
      ours, their wind being made by a great wheel, like a wheel of a
      water-mill, which worked with the fans or wings in a large trough, and
      caused a prodigious issue of air through a small hole in the back of the
      fireplace. They were then drawing out iron bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave each of these men, and also to the woman, a dram of brandy; which
      they swallowed down very greedily, and looked for more, and seemed very
      pleasant. I then inquired into the trade&mdash;by whom and how it was
      carried on; and they told me just as Maleck had done. I then asked where
      the mines lay; and one of them looking full at me said, "Then you know
      what we are about."&mdash;"Yes," says I, "very well."&mdash;He told me the
      mine was (in his language as Maleck interpreted it) about a quarter of a
      mile off, and directed me to it. I ordered them to go on with their work,
      telling them, though I left a guard over them, it was only that they might
      not raise their neighbours to disturb me; though if they did, I should
      serve them all as I had done their companion; and left four men with
      pistols at the archway.
    </p>
    <p>
      I proceeded to the iron mine, but supposed the men were all within, for I
      saw nobody; but there were many large heaps of ore lying, which I felt of;
      and, being vastly heavy, I supposed it might be rich in metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to my men at the arch, and asked them what other mines there
      might be in that country, and of what other metals; but Maleck not knowing
      the metals themselves, was not able to interpret the names they called
      them by. I then showed them an English halfpenny, a Portuguese piece of
      silver money, and my gold watch; and asking if they had any of those, they
      pointed to the halfpenny and silver piece, but shook their heads at the
      watch. I then showed them a musket-ball, and they said they had a great
      deal of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I desired them to show me the way to the copper-mine (pointing my finger
      to the halfpenny), and told them if they would go with me, they should
      have some more (pointing to my brandy); and they readily agreed, if I
      would stand by them for leaving their work. I believe it might be two
      miles farther on the right to the copper-mine; and as these men had the
      graundee, I expected they would have flown by me; but I found they had a
      light chain round their graundee which prevented them; so I walked too,
      and having made them my friends by being familiar with them, I desired
      they would go in, and let the headman of the works know that a stranger
      desired to speak with him and view his works, and to inform him how
      peaceable I was if he used me civilly, but that I could strike him dead at
      once if he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know how they managed, or what report they made; but the man came
      to me very courteously, and I bade Maleck ask if he came in friendship, as
      I did to him; and he giving me that assurance, I went in with him, taking
      Nasgig and Maleck with me, and leaving our firearms without. I ordered
      them both, as I did myself, to carry their cutlasses, sheathed in their
      hands, for fear of a surprise. We saw a great quantity of copper ore and
      several melting-vats, being just at the mouth of the mine, the mine
      running horizontally into the side of the mountain, and, as they said, was
      very rich. I gave the headman a little brandy, and two or three more of
      them, who had been industrious in showing and explaining things to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I desired the foreman to walk out with me; and asking how long he had been
      in that employ, he told me he was a native of the Born Isles, and was
      brought thither young, where he first wrought in the iron, then in the
      silver, and now in this mine: that he had been there twenty years, and
      never expected to be delivered from his miserable slavery; but as he was
      now overseer of that work, he did pretty well, though nothing like
      freedom. He told me they expected several new slaves quickly, for the
      mines killed those they did not agree with so fast they were very thinly
      wrought at present, and that the governor was gone to the isles to get
      more men. I was glad to hear this. "And, pray," says I, "where does the
      governor reside?" He (pointing to the place) told me. "And what guard,"
      says I, "may he keep?"&mdash;"About four hundred men; but nobody durst
      molest him," says he; "for he tortures them in such a manner, never
      killing them, that not the least thing can be done against his will."
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had talked a good while on the misery of slavery, and finding him
      a man fit for my purpose, I asked him if he would go with me to
      Brandle-guarp: "For," said I, "there are certainly good mines in those
      mountains; and if you will overlook them, you shall be free, and have
      whatever you desire." He shook his head, saying, how could he expect to be
      free where all the rest were slaves. "And besides," says he, "they are in
      such commotions among themselves, that it is said the State will be torn
      to pieces."&mdash;"You are mistaken," says I, "very much; I myself have
      settled peace amongst them, and killed the usurper."&mdash;"Is it
      possible?" says he; "and are you the man it was said they expected to come
      out of the sea?"&mdash;"The very same," says I: "and as to slavery, there
      is not a slave in the kingdom; nor shall be here, if you will hearken to
      me."&mdash;"That would be a good time indeed," says he.&mdash;"Well," says
      I, "my friend, I promise you it shall be so; only observe this, that when
      I come to reduce the governor, do none of you miners assist him." He
      promised he would let the other miners secretly know it, and all should be
      as I wished; but desired me to be expeditious, for the governor was
      expected every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went from him to the other mines, and my guides with me; who seeing me
      so well received at the copper-mine and reporting it to the others, it
      caused my proceedings to go on smoothly, and my offers to be readily
      embraced wherever I came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having prepared matters thus, I set Maleck and his countrymen upon the
      natives, to treat with them about submission to Georigetti, on promise of
      freedom; who being assured of what I had done at Brandleguarp, and in
      hopes of like liberty, readily came into it; so that the only thing
      remaining was, before the governor's return, to attack the soldiery.
      Having, therefore, renewed my engagements with the miners, and believing
      myself upon as good terms with the natives as I could wish, I was advised
      by Nasgig and Lasmeel to return for cannon and a large army before I
      attacked the soldiery: but I, who had all my life rode upon the spur,
      having considered that an opportunity once lost is never to be regained;
      and though I could have wished for some cannon, I valued the men but for
      show: I therefore formed my resolves to march with the force I had next
      morning, and pitch upon a plain just by the governor's garrison, in order,
      if I could, to draw his men out. I did so, and it answered; for upon the
      first news of my coming, they appeared with a sort of heavy-headed
      weapons, which hurling round, they threw upwards aslope, in order to light
      upon the backs of their enemies in flight, and beat them down; but they
      could not throw them above thirty paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat still in my chair, with a gun in my hand, and Maleck with another at
      my elbow, with four more lying by me, ready to be presented; Lasmeel
      standing by to charge again as fast as we fired. I ordered a party of
      twenty of my men with cutlasses to attack the van of the enemy, by rushing
      impetuously upon them, they coming but thin against me; for I was not
      willing to employ my pieces till I could do more execution. They began the
      attack about a hundred yards before me, not very high in the air; and my
      cutlass-men having avoided the first flight of their weapons, fell upon
      them with such fury, that chopping here a limb and there a graundee,
      which, disabling their flight, was equally pernicious, they fell by scores
      before me: but I seeing those in the rear, which made a body of near three
      hundred, coming very swift and close in treble ranks, one above the other,
      hoping to bear down my handful of men with their numbers, I ordered my men
      all to retire behind me, and not till the enemy were passed over my head
      to fall on them. Maleck and I, as they came near, each firing a piece
      together, and whipping up another, and then another, in an instant they
      fell round us roaring and making a horrid yell. This the rest seeing, went
      over our men's heads, not without many falling from the cuts of my men;
      and those who escaped were never heard of more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miners, who from their several stations had beheld the action, came
      singing and dancing from every quarter round me, and if I had not drawn my
      men close in a circle about me, would probably, out of affection, have
      done me more hurt than two of the governor's armies; for against these
      common gratitude denied the use of force; and they crowding every one but
      to touch me, they said, for fear of being pressed to death myself, as some
      of them almost were, I ordered them to be let in through my men at one
      side of the ring, and, passing by and touching me, to be let out on the
      other side; and this quieted them, but kept me in penance a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then marched in a body all into the town, where we were going to
      proclaim Georigetti King of Mount Alkoe, when a surly fellow, much wiser
      than the rest, as he thought, being about to harangue the people against
      being too hasty in it, was knocked down and trod to death for his pains;
      and we went on with the proclamation, giving general liberty to all
      persons without exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing to be considered was how to oppose the governor when he
      came; and for that purpose I inquired into the manner of his coming, the
      road he came, and his attendants; and being informed that a hundred of his
      guards who had not the graundee waited for him at the sea-side, and that
      he had got no other guard, except a few friends and the slaves he went
      for, and that the slaves always came first, six in a rank tied together,
      under convoy of a few of his guards, I went in person to view the route he
      came, and seeing a very convenient post in a thick wood through which they
      were to pass, from whence we might see them before they came near us, I
      posted a watch on the sea side of the wood, and myself and men lay on the
      hither side of it, just where the governor's party must come out of it
      again: so that my watch giving notice of their approach, we might be ready
      to fall on at their coming out of our side of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had waited three days, our watch brought word they were coming; so
      we kept as close as possible, letting the slaves and guards march on, who
      came by about two hours' march before the governor: but so soon as he
      approached I drew up my men on the plain within the wood in ranks,
      ordering them to lie close on their bellies till they saw me rise, and
      then to rise, follow me, and obey orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of the first ranks having passed the wood, just as the governor
      had entered the open country, I rose and bade Maleck call aloud that if
      any of them stirred or lifted up a weapon he was a dead man; and then
      seeing one of the foremost running, I fetched him down with a musket-shot,
      bidding Maleck tell the rest that if they submitted and laid down their
      weapons they were safe; but if they refused, I would serve them all as I
      had done him who fled. This speech, with the terror of the gun, fixed
      every man to his place like a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then went forward to the governor, and by Maleck, my interpreter, asked
      him who they all were with him: he told me his slaves. I then made him
      call every man before him and give him freedom; which finding no way to
      avoid (for I looked very stern), he did, and I had enough to do to quiet
      my new freemen, who I thought would have devoured me for joy. I asked him
      whither he was going; he said to his government.&mdash;"Under whom do you
      hold it?" says I.&mdash;"Under the zaps of the isles," says he. I then
      told him that whoever held that government for the future, must receive it
      from the hands of Georigetti, the king of that country, to whom all the
      natives and miners had already engaged their fidelity. I told him both
      natives and foreigners had been all declared free.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor seemed much dejected, and told me he hoped I would not use
      him or his company ill. I told him that depended entirely on his own and
      their good behaviour. I asked him who his friends were that were with him;
      he said they were some of the zap's relations, who were come to see the
      method of the government and inspect the mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordering all the governor's guards and friends to go before, and all my
      own, but Maleck, to keep backwards some paces, I entered into discourse
      with him about the state of the isles, and the country of Alkoe; and
      finding him a judicious person, and not a native of the isles, I thought,
      with some management, he might prove a useful person to me, but did not
      like the character I had heard of his severity: so I plainly told him that
      only one thing prevented my making him a greater man than ever he was;
      which was, I had been informed he had a roughness in his nature which
      drove him to extremities with the poor slaves, which I could not bear.
      "Sir," says he, "whatever a man is in his natural temper, where slavery
      abounds it is necessary to act, or at least be thought to do so, in a
      merciless manner. I am intrusted with the government of a land of only
      slaves; who have no more love, nor are they capable of any, for me, than
      the herbs of the ground have. I am to render an account to my masters of
      their labours; they work by force, and would not stir a step without it,
      or the fear of correction; for which reason the rod must be ever held over
      them; and though I seldom let it fall, when I do the suffering of one is
      too long remembered to permit others quickly to subject themselves to the
      like punishment: and this method I judged to be the most mild, as the
      death or sufferings of one but seldom, must, though ever so severe, be
      milder than the frequent execution of numbers. And as to my appearing
      severe to them, my post required it; for mercy to slaves being interpreted
      into fear, arms them with violence against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not gainsay this, especially as he told me he was glad that I had
      freed them all: "For no man," says he, "but if he were to choose, would
      rather reign by love (which he may in a free country, but it is
      impracticable in one of slaves) than by fear, which alone will keep the
      latter in subjection."
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him whether, as he knew the nature of the country, and the
      business of the governor, he could become faithful to my master
      Georigetti. He told me he had ever been faithful to his masters the zaps,
      and would till he was sure (without suspecting in the least my veracity)
      all was true that I was pleased to tell him; for nothing could satisfy his
      conscience but being an eye-witness of it, and then being discharged from
      any further capacity of serving them in an open way, he should be free to
      choose his own master; of all whom, Georigetti should to him be most
      preferable; but begged me not to interpret his desire of retaining
      fidelity to his old masters till he could no longer serve them, into an
      implication of assisting them by either open or concealed practices; for,
      wherever he engaged, he would be true to the utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of six days (for I travelled on foot with them) we arrived at
      the governor's palace, which we found without a guard, and all the slaves
      he had sent before him at liberty; so I ordered my men to supply the usual
      guard, and took my lodging in the governor's apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Gadsi (for that was the governor's name) was not confined, or any of
      his friends, he came into my apartment, and told me since he had found all
      things answered my report, if I pleased, he would quit the palace to me,
      and everything belonging to the government. I told him he said well. He
      did so, taking with him only some few things, his own property. So soon as
      he was without the territory of the palace, I sent for him and his friends
      back again. He could not help being dejected at his return, fearing some
      mischief. "Gadsi," says I, "this palace and this country, which I now hold
      for my master Georigetti, I deliver in custody to you as his governor; and
      now charge you to make acknowledgment of your fidelity to him." Then
      taking it from him in terms of my own proposing, I delivered him the
      regalia, of his government, charging him to maintain freedom: "But," says
      I, "let no man eat who will not work, as the country and the produce are
      the king's."
    </p>
    <p>
      I then summoned an assembly of the people, and sent notice to all the
      miners to attend me. I told them all that the king desired of them was to
      make themselves happy: "And as the mines at present," says I, "are the
      only employment of this country, I would have it agreed by your own
      consent&mdash;for I will force nothing upon you&mdash;that every man
      amongst you, from sixteen to sixty, shall work every third week at the
      mines and other duties of the government; and two weeks out of three shall
      be your own to provide in for your families: and if I live to come back
      again, you shall each man have so much land of his own as shall be
      sufficient for his family; and I will make it my business to see for seeds
      to improve it with. And this week's work in three, and if afterwards it
      can be done with less in four, shall be an acknowledgment to the king for
      his bounty to you. Do you agree to this?" They all, with one voice, cried
      out, "We do!"&mdash;"Then," says I, "agree amongst yourselves, and part
      into proper divisions for carrying on the work; that is, into four parts,
      one for each sort of metal; and then again, each of those four into three
      parts; and on every seventh day in the morning, let those who are to begin
      meet those who are leaving off work; so that there be clear six days'
      work, and one of going and returning. Do you all agree to this?"&mdash;All
      cried, "We do!"&mdash;"Then," says I, "whoever neglects his duty, unless
      through sickness, or by leave of the governor, shall work a double week.
      Do you agree to this?"&mdash;"We do!"&mdash;"Then all matters of
      difference between you shall be decided by the governor; and in case of
      any injury or injustice, or wrong judgment in the governor, by Georigetti.
      Do you agree?"&mdash;"We do!"&mdash;"Then," says I, "agree upon ten men,
      two for the natives, and two for each mineral work, to send with me to
      Brandleguarp, to petition Georigetti to confirm these laws, till you shall
      make others yourselves, and to acknowledge his sovereignty. Do you agree?"&mdash;"We
      do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I then told them that as those who had been slaves were now free, they
      might, if they pleased, return home; but as I should make it my endeavour
      to provide so well for them in all the comforts of life, I believed most
      of them would be of opinion their interests would keep them where they
      were. And, above all things, recommending a hearty union between the new
      freemen and the natives, and to marry amongst each other, and to continue
      in love amongst themselves, and duty to the king and his governor; and
      promising speedily to return and settle what was wanting, I dismissed the
      assembly and set out for Brandleguarp with the ten deputies; but I left
      Lasmeel behind with the governor, and two servants with him, to give me
      immediate notice in case any disturbance should happen in my absence.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S we alighted at
      the palace late at night, I kept the deputies with me till next morning,
      when I went to the king, desiring them to stay in my apartment till I had
      received his majesty's orders for their admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was but just up when I came in; and seeing me, embraced me,
      saying: "Dear father, I am glad to meet you again alive; your stay has
      given me the utmost perplexity; and could I have prevailed with any of my
      servants to have followed you, I had sent before this time to have known
      what was become of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      I told his majesty, the greatest pleasure of my life consisted in the
      knowledge of his majesty's esteem for me; and he might depend upon it, I
      would take care of myself from a double motive whilst I was in his
      dominions; the one, from the natural obligation of my own preservation,
      and the other, equally compulsive, of continuing serviceable to his
      majesty, till I had made him more famous than his ancestor, the great
      Begsurbeck.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told his majesty, as a small token of my duty and affection to him, I
      was come to make him a tender of the additional title of King of Mount
      Alkoe.&mdash;"Father," says he, "we shall never be able to get a
      sufficient number of my subjects to go thither; for though your safe
      return may be some encouragement, yet whilst their old apprehensions
      subsist (and I know not what will alter them) we can do no good; and
      indeed were they free to go, and under no suspicion of danger, it would
      cost abundance of men to conquer Mount Alkoe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great sir," said I, "you mistake me: I told you I came to make you a
      tender of it; I have proclaimed you king there, and freedom to the people;
      I have held an assembly of the kingdom, placed a governor, taken the
      engagement of himself and subjects to you, settled laws amongst them for
      your benefit, the full third part of all their labour; have brought ten
      deputies, two from each denomination of people among them; and they only
      wait your command to be admitted, to beg your acceptance of their
      submission, and pray your royal protection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," says the king, "you amaze me! but as it is your doing, let them
      come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      The deputies being received, and heard by Maleck, their interpreter, very
      graciously, the king told them, in a very favourable speech, that whatever
      his father had done, or should do, they might accept as done by himself;
      and commanded them to remind the governor, for whom he had the highest
      esteem, to observe the laws, without the least deviation, till his father
      should make such further additions as were consistent with his own honour
      and their future freedom; and having feasted them in a most magnificent
      manner, they returned, highly satisfied with the honours they had
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      This transaction being immediately noised abroad, all the colambs came
      themselves; and the great cities, by their deputies, sent his majesty
      their compliments upon the occasion; and there was nothing but mirth and
      rejoicing throughout the whole kingdom. And those who had refused going
      with me, as Maleck told me, hung their heads for shame and sorrow that
      they had missed the opportunity of bearing a part in the expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I demonstrated to the king that the only way to preserve that kingdom was
      to settle a large colony on the plains, between the mountain and the sea,
      to intercept clandestine trade, and make a stand against any force that
      might be sent from the Little Lands to recover the mines. And I promised
      to be present at the settlement, and an assistant in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the colambs, as I said, being at court upon this complimentary
      affair, the king summoned them for their advice on my proposals, and told
      them he had ordered me to lay before them my thoughts on the affairs of
      that kingdom; and after many compliments and encomiums had passed on me, I
      told them the necessity of the colony, the commodity that would arise from
      it, how I intended to manage it, and what prospect I had of introducing
      amongst them several extraordinary conveniences they had never before had.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colambs, who, for want of practice this way, knew but little of the
      matter, thinking, nevertheless, that in the general turn of things they
      must somehow come in for a share, approved of all I said. I desired them
      then to settle out of what part of the people, and how to be nominated,
      such choice of the colony as should be made for the new settlement; but
      found them much at a loss to fix on any method of doing it. So I told them
      I believed it would be the best way to issue an order for such as would
      willingly go, to repair to a particular rendezvous; and in case sufficient
      should not appear voluntarily, to issue another order that the colambs,
      out of their several districts, should complete the number, so as to make
      a body of 12,000 men of arms, besides women and children; and that such a
      territory should be allotted to each, with so much wood-grounds, in common
      to all, as would suffice for their subsistence; all which passed the vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then told them that this large people must have a head, or governor, to
      keep them to their duties, and to determine matters of property, and all
      disputes amongst them. Here they one and all nominated me; but I told them
      I apprehended I could be more useful other ways, having too many things in
      my head for the general good, to confine myself to any particular
      province; but if they would excuse me in presuming to recommend a person,
      it should be Nasgig. And immediately Nasgig being sent for, and accepting
      it, they conferred it upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things, as I judged, went on in so smooth a way, in reference to the
      new colony, that I was preparing, with the assistance of the proper
      officer, expresses to be sent with the king's gripsacks into the several
      provinces, with notice of these orders, and an appointment for a
      rendezvous. But while this was doing, abundance of people came crowding
      about me to be informed whether I thought it safe for them to go; and I
      believe I had fully satisfied all their scruples, when by some management
      of the ragans, who, having so long declared Mount Alkoe to be inhabited by
      Mindrack, did not care the people should all of a sudden find out they had
      deceived them, there was a report ran current, that though I and my
      bearers, who were all Mount Alkoe men, returned safe, yet if any of the
      Brandleguarpines had gone, they would never have come back again. This
      rumour coming to my ears, and fearing whitherto it might grow, I had no
      small prospect of a disappointment, and I thereupon stopped issuing the
      orders till I had considered what farther to do in the affair. At length,
      being persuaded I had already satisfied abundance of their scruples, and
      in order to dissipate the doubts of others, and to familiarise them in
      some measure to the country and people of Mount Alkoe, I proposed a prize
      to be flown for, and gave notice of it for six days all about the country,
      both to those of Mount Alkoe, and those of Sass Doorpt Swangeanti, that
      whoever, except those who were with me in the late expedition, should make
      the most speedy flight to the governor's of Mount Alkoe, to carry a
      message and bring me an answer from Lasmeel, should have one of my
      pistols, with a quantity of powder, and so many balls; and the person who
      should be second, should have a cutlass and belt. The time being fixed,
      very few had entered in the first two or three days; but on the third day
      came several over from Alkoe to enter, which the Brandleguarpines seeing,
      and having equal inclination to the prize, after half a dozen of them had
      entered on the fourth morning, before noon on the fifth I had near sixty
      of them on my list, besides the Alkoe men, making in all about one
      hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of starting was fixed for the sixth morning, from off the rock on
      the back-side of the palace, upon my firing a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unusual diversion occasioned a prodigious confluence of spectators;
      for scarce a person in Brandleguarp, except those who were either too
      young or too old for flight, but were upon one or other of the rocks; even
      the king himself and all his court were there, with infinite numbers from
      all distant parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had despatched a letter by one of my old bearers to Lasmeel some days
      before, to inform him of it, that he might get two letters ready wrote,
      one to deliver to the first, and another to the second messenger, but not
      to take farther notice of the rest. Now, my flight-race being for the
      equal benefit of both the kingdoms, it happened, as I was in hopes it
      would, that so many of the Mount Alkoans coming over to me to be entered,
      and staying with me till the flight began, and such vast numbers of
      persons meeting of both nations upon the Black Mountain, to see them go
      and return, and several of the Swangeantines going, out of bravado, quite
      through with the flyers; the intercourse of the two nations was that day
      so great, and the discourse they had with the natives and miners so
      stripped the Swangeantines of their old apprehensions of danger from Mount
      Alkoe, that in three days after the whole dread of the place was vanished,
      and he would then have been thought mad who had attempted to revive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time being come, I set my flyers in a row on the outer edge of the
      rock; and having given notice that no one should presume to rise till the
      flyers were on the graundee, and at such a distance, I then let the flyers
      know I should soon give fire; which I had no sooner done but down they all
      dropped as one man, as it were, headlong from the edge of the mountain,
      and presently the whole field were after them. They skimmed with
      incredible swiftness across the face of the plain, between the rock and
      the mountain; the force of which descent swung them as it were up the
      mountain's side in an almost upright posture, till seeming to sweep the
      edge of the mountain with their bellies, they slid over its surface till
      they were lost in the body of the Swangean, our rocks echoing the shouts
      of the mountaineers. I fired my pistol, by my watch, at nine o'clock in
      the morning, but had no occasion to inquire when it was thought they would
      return, for every one was passing his opinion upon it. Some said it could
      not be till midnight, or very near it; and others, that it would be almost
      next morning. However, we went to dinner, and coming again about six
      o'clock by my watch, I was told by the people on the rock, as the general
      opinion (for it was then topfull), that they could not yet be expected for
      a long time; and the major part concluded they could not be half-way home
      yet; when, on a sudden, we heard a prodigious shout from the mountain,
      which growing nearer and nearer to us, and louder and louder, in a few
      moments came a slim young fellow, and nimbly alighting on the rock,
      tripped briskly forward, as not being able to stop himself at once from
      the violence of the force he came with, and delivered me a letter from
      Lasmeel as I was sitting in my chair. I gave him joy of the prize, and
      ordered him to come to my apartment so soon as I got home, and he should
      have it. I then asked him where he had left the other flyers; he told me
      he knew nothing of them since he came past the forges in his return; for
      there he met them going to Lasmeel.&mdash;"Why that," says I, "must be a
      great way on this side the governor's." He told me about an hour's flight.
      I then told him, as he must be strained with so hard a flight, it would be
      better if he lay down, and called on me in the morning. He thanked me, and
      after he had told me his name was Walsi, he said he would take my advice,
      and springing up as light as air, went off, the rock being quite thronged
      with those who had followed from the mountain to see the victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Walsi came in, it was just seven o'clock by my watch; so that,
      according to the best computation by miles I could make from their
      descriptions of things, I judged he had flown at little more or less than
      at the rate of a mile a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stayed till near nine o'clock upon the rock, where it being cold and the
      time tedious, I was taking Quilly home with me, and designed that Maleck
      should wait for the coming of the second; but hearing again a shout from
      the mountain I resolved to see the second come in myself. The noise
      increasing, I presently saw the whole air full of people very near me, for
      I had retired near two hundred paces from the edge of the rock to give
      room to the flyers to alight, and expected nothing less than to be borne
      down by them; when I spied two competitors, one just over the back of the
      other, the uppermost bearing down upon the other's graundee, their heads
      being just equal; so that the under man perceiving it impossible to sink
      lower for the rock, or to mount higher for the man above him, and as
      darting side-ways would lose time, and fearing to brush his belly against
      the rock, he slackened, just to job up his head in his antagonist's
      stomach; which giving the upper man a smart check with the pain, and the
      under one striking at that instant one bold stroke with his graundee, he
      fell just with his head at my feet, and the other man upon him, with his
      head in the under man's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they lay for a considerable time, breathless and motionless, save the
      working of their lungs, and heaving of their breasts; when each asked me
      if he was not the first, and the under man giving me a letter, I told them
      "No, Walsi had been in almost two hours ago." They both said it was
      impossible; they were sure no glumm in the Doorpt could outfly either of
      them. I ordered them both to call on me in the morning, and I would see
      they should have right done to their pretensions. The under man had but
      just told me his name was Naggitt, when another arrived, who, seeing
      Naggitt before him, told me he was sure he was second; but on seeing the
      other also he gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would stay no longer, it being now so late; but the next morning I was
      informed that all the rest had stopped at the mountain but two, who were
      obliged to give out before, being overstrained, and unable to hold it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Walsi was the first at my apartment, when I happened to
      be with the king; and speaking of his business to Quilly, he ordered him
      to stay in my gallery till I came back; and Quilly presently after seeing
      Youwarkee, told her the victor at the flight-race was waiting for me in
      the gallery. Youwarkee, who had great curiosity to see him, having heard
      how long he came in before the rest, stepped into the gallery, and taking
      a turn or two there, fell into discourse with him about his flight. And as
      women are very inquisitive, she distinguished, by the flyer's answers,
      speech, shape, and manner of address, that it was certainly a gawry she
      was talking with; though she had endeavoured to disguise herself by
      rolling in her hair, and tying it round her head with a broad chaplet,
      like a man; and by the thinness of her body, and flatness of her breasts,
      might fairly enough have passed for one, to a less penetrating eye than
      Youwarkee's. But Youwarkee putting some questions to her, and saying she
      was more like a gawry than a glumm, she put the poor girl&mdash;for so it
      was&mdash;to the blush, and at last she confessed the deceit; but upon her
      knees begged Youwarkee not to mention it, for it would be her undoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This confession gave Youwarkee a fair opportunity of asking how she came
      to be an adventurer for this sort of prize. The girl, finding there was no
      remedy, frankly confessed she had a strong affection for a glumboss, who
      was a very stout glumm, she said, but somewhat too corpulent for speedy
      flight; who ever since the prize had been proposed, could rest neither
      night nor day, to think he was not so well qualified to put in for it as
      others, especially one Naggitt, who he well knew made his addresses to
      her, and also was an adventurer. "Had it been a matter of strength,
      valour, or manhood," says he, "I had had the best of chances for it; but
      to be under a natural incapacity of obtaining so glorious a prize, as even
      the king himself is not master of such another, I cannot bear it." She
      then said he had told her he was resolved to give in his name and do his
      utmost, though he died in the flight. "What!" said he, "shall I see
      Naggitt run away with it, and perhaps with you too, when he has that to
      lay at your feet which no glumm else can boast of? No; I'll overcome, or
      never come home without it!"&mdash;"I must confess, madam," says Walsi,
      "as I knew his high spirit could never bear to be vanquished, I was afraid
      he would be as good as his word, and come to some unlucky end; and told
      him that though he need not have feared being conqueror in anything else,
      had it been proposed, yet in flight there were so many, half glumms as
      they were, who from their effeminate make and size, and little value for
      anything else, would certainly be in before him; that it was unworthy of a
      thorough glumm to contend with them for what could be obtained only by
      those who had no right to or share in anything more excellent; and that he
      must therefore not think of more than his fatigue for his pains. But as he
      had set his heart so much upon it, I would enter, and try to get it for
      him, as from my size and make, I believed few would have a better chance
      for it than myself. And, thanks to Collwar, madam," says she, "I hope to
      make him easy in it, if you will but please to conceal your knowledge of
      who and what I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Youwarkee was mightily pleased with her story, and promised she would; but
      engaged her to come again to her apartment so soon as she was possessed of
      the prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned, hearing Walsi waited for me, I called him in, read the
      letter he brought, and finding it Lasmeel's, I looked over my list for
      Walsi's name, for I set them all down as they entered; and finding it the
      very last name of all, and that it was entered but on the morning the race
      was flown: "So," says I, "Walsi, I find the last at entering is the first
      at returning; but I see you have been there, by what Lasmeel has sent me;
      though there were some last night who questioned it, by your so speedy
      return. Here," says I, "take the prize, and see they are only used in the
      service of your country;" and then I dismissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      My two competitors appeared next for the cutlass, and had each of them
      many arguments to prevail with me in favour of him; but I told them I must
      do justice, and that though the difference was so small between them, yet
      certainly Naggitt was the nearest me at the time they both ceased flight,
      his face lying on my foot; so that as they both complained of foul play,
      and were therefore equal in that respect, Naggitt in justice must have it.
      And I gave it him with these words, however: "Take it, Naggitt, as
      certainly yours by the law of the race, but with a diffidence in myself
      who best deserves it."
    </p>
    <p>
      I own I pitied the other man's case very much, as I should Naggitt's, had
      the other won it; but seeing the other turning away, and hearing him say,
      "But by half a head; when I had strove so hard!" as in a sort of
      dejection, I told them they were both brave glumms, and of intrepid
      resolution; and gave him also one, with the like instruction as to Walsi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walsi went from me, as she had promised, to Youwarkee, who wanted more
      discourse with her; for in an affair of love her gentle heart could have
      dwelt all day upon the repetition of any circumstances which would create
      delight in the enamoured. Walsi sat on thorns, wanting to be gone; but
      Youwarkee asking question upon question, Walsi got up and begged she would
      excuse her, she would come and stay at any other time. "But," says she,
      "madam, when the man one loves is in pain&mdash;for I am sure he is on the
      rack for fear of a discovery, till he sees me&mdash;if you ever loved
      yourself, you can't blame me for pressing to relieve him."
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone, Youwarkee finding me alone, was so full of Walsi's
      adventure she could not be silent; but after twenty roundabout speeches
      and promises that I was to make, not to be angry with anybody, or undo
      anything I had done that day, and I know not what, out came the story. I
      was prodigiously pleased with it, and wished I had taken more notice of
      her. Says Youwarkee, "I endeavoured to keep her till you had done, that
      you might have seen her."&mdash;"And why did not you?" says I.&mdash;"My
      dear," says Youwarkee, "had you seen the poor creature's uneasiness till
      she got off with it, yourself could not have had the heart to have
      deferred that pleasure you would have perceived she expected when she came
      home; nor could you in conscience have detained her."

      notwithstanding all that the ragans could say to keep up their credit, and
      to prevent the people's perceiving what fools they had made of them, had
      so good and sudden an effect on the people's prejudices, that upon issuing
      the first proclamation, there was no occasion for the second; for at least
      twenty-five thousand men appeared voluntarily at the rendezvous of the old
      slaves, whose masters, though they were declared free, had used divers
      devices to oppress them, and render even their freedom a sort of slavery,
      besides women and children; so that we had now only to pick and choose
      those who would be likeliest to be of service to the new colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nasgig and I differed now about the choice of persons. He, as a soldier,
      was for taking mostly single young men, and I for taking whole families,
      though some were either too old or too young for war. And upon farther
      consideration he agreed with me; for I told him young men would leave a
      father, mother, or mistress, behind them, which would either cause a
      hankering after home, and consequently the bad example of desertion, or
      else create an uneasy spirit, and perhaps a general distaste to the
      settlement. So we chose those whole families where they offered, which had
      the most young men in them, first; then others in like order; after that,
      man by man, asking them severally if any woman they liked would go with
      them, and if so, we took her, till we had about thirteen thousand fighting
      men, besides old men, women, and children; and then, marching by the
      palace, the king ordered ten days' stores for every mouth, and with this
      we took our flight; but as I was always fearful of a concourse in the air,
      Nasgig led them, and I brought up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the above number of people, I believe we could not have less than
      ten thousand volunteers to the Black Mountain; some to take leave of their
      friends, and others out of curiosity, to see our flight. I took three
      pieces of cannon with me, and proper stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first stage, after a short halt on the Black Mountain, was to the
      governor's palace, where Gadsi received us with great respect. I told him
      my errand, which he approved: "For," says he, "countryman, it is now as
      much my interest to keep my old masters out, as ever it was to serve them
      when in; and you have taken the only method in the world to do it
      effectually." I consulted him where I should fix my colony; and, by his
      advice, fixed it on this side the wood, with some scattering habitations
      behind the wood, as watch-houses, to give notice of an enemy, having the
      wood for shelter, before they could reach the town, and, at the worst, the
      town for a retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found by Gadsi, that the ships from the Little Lands were soon expected,
      for that he said the zaps knew nothing yet of the change of government,
      nor could, till the ships returned. He asked me, as there was now a good
      lading, whether I thought fit to let them have it upon proper terms. I
      told him I would not hinder their having the metals, or endeavour to stop
      their trade in the least, but should be glad to treat with them about it
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave the forgemen descriptions for making shovels, spades, pick-axes,
      hammers, and abundance of other iron implements I should want in the
      building the new town: all which we got ready and carried with us. We then
      took flight, and alighted on the spot of our intended city; and having
      viewed the ground some miles each way, we drew the outlines, and set a
      great number of hands to cutting down trees, digging holes, and making
      trenches for the foundations. In short, we were all hands at it, and the
      women fetched the provisions; but I was obliged to show them every single
      step they were to take, towards the new erections; and, I must say, it was
      with great pleasure I did it, they seldom wanting to be told twice, having
      as quick an apprehension of what they heard or saw, as any people I had
      ever met with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole city, according to our plan, was to consist of several long
      straight streets, parallel to each other, with gardens backwards each way,
      and traverse-passages at proper distances, to cross each street, from one
      to the other, quite through the whole city.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this work was in hand, I took a progress to view the other country
      Maleck had told me of. We had not taken a very long flight, before we saw
      at a distance several persons of that country travelling to Mount Alkoe
      for metals. I had a great mind to have some talk with them about their
      kingdom, and ordered my bearers to go to them; they told me they durst
      not, for one of them would kill ten men. I did not choose to force them to
      it, for fear of some mischief; but observing which way they came, and that
      they came in several small bodies, of six or eight together, and that
      there was a little wood and some bushes between me and them, I ordered my
      bearers to sink beneath the trees out of their sight, and to ground me
      just at the foot of the wood; for I resolved to know something more of
      them before we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay perdue till they arrived within sixty paces of me; then asking
      Maleck if he knew their language, and he telling me he did, having often
      conversed with them at the mines, I bid him greet them, and tell them I
      was a friend, and be sure to stand by me. There were seven of them, and
      many more at different distances. I showed myself, and Maleck spoke to
      them, when two or three of the hindermost ran quite away; one stood and
      looked very surly, but the rest, who had stood with him, turning to run, I
      bid Maleck tell him if he did not call them back I would kill them. He
      that stood then called to them, but they mending their pace upon it, I let
      fly, and shot one in the shoulder, who dropping, I was afraid I had killed
      him. I then went up to the other, who had not stirred even at the report
      of the gun, seeming quite terrified. I took him by the hand and kissed it,
      which made him recover himself a little, and he took mine and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bid Maleck tell him I was a great traveller, and only wanted to talk
      with him; but seeing the man I had shot stir, I went to him, and told him
      I was sorry I had hurt him, which I should not have attempted had he not
      shown a mistrust of me by running away, for I could not bear that: this I
      said to keep the other with me. I saw I had hurt his shoulder, but being
      at a great distance, the ball had not entered the blade-bone, but stopping
      there, had fallen out; so tying my handkerchief over it, I told him I
      hoped it would soon be well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I inquired into their country, its name, the intent of their journey this
      way, their trades, the fruits, birds, and beasts of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man I had shot, I found, was in pain, which gave me no little concern;
      so I chiefly applied myself to the other, who told me the name of his
      country was Norbon, a large kingdom, and very populous, he said, in some
      parts of it, and was governed by Oniwheske, an old and good king. "He has
      only one daughter," says he, "named Stygee; so that I am afraid when he
      dies it will go to a good-for-nothing nephew of his, a desperate debauched
      man, who will probably ruin us, and destroy that kingdom which has been in
      the Oniwheske family these fifteen hundred years."&mdash;"Won't his
      daughter have the kingdom," says I, "after his death, or her children?"&mdash;"Children,"
      says he, "no, that's the pity; all would be well if she had but children,
      and the state continue fifteen hundred years longer in the same good
      family."&mdash;"How is it possible for any one to know that?" says I. "You
      may know how long it has, but how long it will last, is mere guess-work."&mdash;"No,"
      says he, "this very time, and the present circumstances of our kingdom,
      were foretold at the birth of the first king we ever had, who was of the
      present royal family."&mdash;"How so?" says I.&mdash;"Why," says he,
      "before we had any king, we had a very good old man, who lived retired in
      a cave by the sea; and to him everybody under their difficulties repaired
      for advice. This old man happening to be very ill, everybody was under
      great affliction for fear they should lose him; when flocking to his
      assistance, he told them they need not fear his death till the birth of a
      king who should reign fifteen hundred years. At hearing this all persons
      then present apprehended that his disorder had turned his brain; but he
      persisted in it, and recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After a few years, a great number of persons being about him, he told
      them he must now depart, for that their king was born, and pointed to a
      sucking child a poor woman had then in her arms. It caused a great wonder
      in his audience at the thoughts of that poor child ever becoming a king;
      but he told them it was so decreed, and farther, that as he was to die the
      next day, if they would gather all together, he would let them know what
      was to come in future times.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When they were met, the woman and child being amongst them, he told them
      that child was their king, and that his loins should produce them a race
      of kings for fifteen hundred years, during which time they should be
      happily governed; but then a female inhabitant of the skies should claim
      the dominion, and, together with the kingdom, be utterly destroyed, unless
      a messenger from above, with a crown in each hand, should procure her a
      male of her own kind; and then the kingdom should remain for the like
      number of years to her posterity. Now," says he, "the time will expire
      very soon, and as no one has been, or it is believed will ever come, with
      two such crowns, the princess Stygee, though she undoubtedly will try for
      it, has little hopes of succeeding her father; for her cousin Felbamko
      pretends, as no woman ever reigned with us, he is the right heir, and will
      have the kingdom."&mdash;"Pray," says I, "what do you mean by an
      inhabitant of the air?"&mdash;"Oh," says he, "she flies."&mdash;"And do
      most of your country folks fly?" says I; "for I perceive you don't."&mdash;"No,"
      says he, "no one but the princess Stygee."&mdash;"How comes that about?"
      says I.&mdash;"Her mother, when she was with child with her," says he,
      "being one day in a wood near the palace, and having straggled from her
      company, was attacked by a man with a graundee, who, not knowing her,
      clasped her within his graundee, and would have debauched her; but
      perceiving her cries had brought some of her servants to her assistance,
      he quitted her and went off: this accident threw her into such a fright,
      that it was a long time before she recovered; and then was delivered of a
      daughter with a graundee."&mdash;"My friend," says I, "your meeting with
      me will be a very happy affair for your kingdom. I am the man the princess
      expects: go back to the princess and let her and her father know I will be
      with them in six days, and establish his dominions in the princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow looked at me, thinking I joked, but never offered to stir a
      foot. "Why don't you go?" says I. "And for the good news you bear to the
      princess, I'll see you shall be made one of the greatest men in Norbon."
      The man smiled still, but could not conceive I was in earnest. I asked him
      then how long he should be in going to the palace; he said, "Three days at
      soonest."&mdash;"Deliver but your message right," says I, "and I'll assure
      you it shall be the better for you." The man seeing me look serious, did
      at length believe me, and promised he would obey me punctually; but he had
      not seen how I came to the place he met me at, for I had ordered my
      bearers into the wood with my chair before I showed myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived, as I afterwards found, at the palace, the fourth morning very
      early; and passing the guard in a great heat, with much ado was introduced
      to the king, and discharged himself of my message. His majesty, giving no
      credit to him, thought he had been mad; but he affirming it to be true,
      and telling the king at what a distance I had knocked down his companion,
      and made a great hole in his back, only holding up a thing I had in my
      hand, which made a great noise, Oniwheske ordered his daughter to come
      before him, who having herself heard the man's report, and being very
      willing to believe it, with the king's leave, desired that the messenger
      might be detained till the appointed day, and taken care of; and that
      preparation should be made for the reception of the stranger, in case it
      should be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of my coming, and my errand, excited every one's curiosity to
      see me arrive; and the day being come, I hovered over the city a
      considerable time, to be sure of grounding right. The king and his
      daughter, on the rumour of my appearing, came forth to view me and receive
      me at my alighting. The people were collected into a large square, on one
      side of the palace, and standing in several clusters at different places,
      I judged where the king might seem most likely to be, and ordered my
      bearers to alight there; but I happened upon the most unlucky post, as it
      might have proved, and at the same time the most lucky I could have found
      there; for I had scarce raised myself from my chair, but Felbamko pushing
      up to me through the throng, and lifting up a large club he had in his
      hand, had certainly despatched me, if I had not at the instant drawn a
      pistol from my girdle, and shot him dead upon the spot; insomuch that the
      club, which was then over my head, fell gently down on my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not then know who it was I had killed, but for fear of a fresh
      attempt, I drew out another pistol and my cutlass, and inquiring at which
      part of the square the king was, I walked directly up to him, he not as
      yet knowing what had happened. His majesty and his daughter met me, and
      welcomed me into his dominions. I fell at the king's feet, telling him I
      brought a message, which I hoped would excuse my entering his majesty's
      dominions without the formality of obtaining his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came to the palace, the king ordered some refreshments to be given
      me and my servants; and then that I should be conducted to the room of
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of Felbamko's death had reached the palace before us, and that
      it was by my hand; this greatly surprised the whole court, but proved
      agreeable news to Stygee.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my entrance into the room of audience, the king was sitting at the
      farther end of it against the wall, with his daughter on his right hand;
      and a seat was placed for me at his left, but nearer to the middle of the
      room side-ways, on which I was ordered to sit down. There were abundance
      of the courtiers present, and above me was a seat ordered for one of them,
      who I found afterwards was one of the religious.
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty asked me aloud how it happened that the first moment of my
      entering his dominions I should dip my hands in blood, and that, too, of
      one of his nearest relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then got up to make my answer, but his majesty ordering me to my seat
      again, I told him that as it was most certain I knew no one person in his
      kingdom, so it could not be supposed I could have an ill design against
      any one, especially against that royal blood, into whose hands I then came
      to render myself; but the truth was that what I had done was in
      preservation of my own life, for that the person slain had rushed through
      the crowd upon me with a great club, intending to murder me, and that
      whilst the blow was over my head, I killed him in such position, that by
      his fall the club rested on my shoulder, but was then too weak to hurt me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king asking if that was the real case, several from the lower end of
      the room said they were informed it was, and one in particular said he saw
      the transaction, and I had declared it faithfully. "Then," says the king,
      "you are acquitted; and, now, what brings you hither? relate your
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great sir," says I, "it is my peculiar happiness to be appointed by
      Providence as the proposer of a marriage for the princess Stygee your
      daughter, with a potent neighbouring monarch, having already been enabled
      to perform things past belief for his honour. Know then, great sir, I am a
      native of the north, and through infinite perils and hardships at last
      arrived in the dominions of Georigetti, where I have given peace to his
      State by the death of the usurper Harlokin. I have also just conquered the
      kingdom of Mount Alkoe for my master, and am here come to make your
      daughter an offer of both crowns, and also of all that is my master's,
      with his person in marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old priest then rose, and said: "May it please your majesty, we are
      almost right; but what has always staggered me is, how the person should
      come, for the messenger to us on this errand is to come from above. Now
      this person has not the graundee, and therefore could not come from
      thence. As for the rest, I understand the prince from whom he brings this
      offer to your daughter has the graundee, and so is a male of her own kind;
      and I understand the two kingdoms in his possession to be the two crowns
      in the messenger's hands; but, I say, what I stick at is his coming from
      above."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" says Stygee, "did not you see him come?"&mdash;"No," says he.&mdash;"Oh,"
      says she, "he came in the air, and was a long time over the city before he
      descended."&mdash;"That's impossible," says the old priest, "for he is
      smooth like us."&mdash;"Indeed, sir," says she, "I saw him, and so did
      most of the court." The king and nobles then attesting this truth: "Sir,"
      says the priest to the king, "it is completed, and your majesty must do
      the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I little expected," says the king, "to see this day; and now, daughter,
      as this message was designed for you, you only can answer it. But still I
      must say it surpasses my comprehension, that in the decree of Providence
      it should be so ordered that the very hand which brings the accomplishment
      of what has been so long since foretold us, should, without design, have
      first destroyed all that could have rendered the marriage state
      uncomfortable to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stygee then declared she submitted to fate and her father's will.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stayed here a week to view the country and the sea, which I heard was
      not far off. Here were many useful beasts for food and burden, fowls also
      in plenty, and fish near the sea-coasts, and the people eat flesh, so that
      I thought myself amongst mankind again. I made all the remarks the
      shortness of the time would allow, and then taking my leave departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to the colony, where I heard that the Little-landers had been
      on the coast; but I not being there, or any lading ready, they were gone
      away again; however, they had detained two of them. I was pleased with
      that, but sorry they were returned empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I examined the prisoners, and by giving them liberty and good usage they
      settled amongst us; and the next fleet that came, the sailors to a man
      were all my own the moment they could get to shore. This, though I thought
      it would have spoiled our trade at first, brought the islanders and me to
      the following compromise, and upon this occasion. Their ships having laid
      on our coasts one whole season for want of hands to carry them back, I
      came to an agreement with their commanders (for they were all willing to
      return), that such a number of them should be left as hostages with me
      till the return of a number of my own men, which I should lend them to
      navigate their ships home; and I sent word to the zaps that as it might be
      beneficial to us both to keep the trade still on foot, to prevent the like
      inconveniences for the future, I would buy their shipping, paying for them
      in metals, and agree to furnish them yearly with such a quantity of my
      goods at a stated price, and would send them by my own people; which they
      approving, the trade went on in a very agreeable and profitable manner,
      and we in time built several new vessels of our own, and employed
      abundance of hands in the trade, and had plenty of handicraftsmen of
      different occupations, each of whom I obliged to keep three natives under
      him, to be trained up in his business.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T my return to
      Sass Doorpt Swangeanti, I went directly to the king, and giving him an
      account of the settlement, and my proceedings thereon, he told me his
      whole kingdom would not be an equivalent for the services I had done him.
      I begged of him to look on them in no other light than as flowing from my
      duty; but if, when I should be no more, he or his children would be
      gracious to my family, it was all I desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, father," says the king, "I can undertake for myself; but who's to
      come after me, nobody knows, for I shall never marry. No! Yaccom-bourse
      has given me a surfeit of womankind; and unless the states will settle the
      kingdom on you, to which I will consent, it will probably be torn to
      pieces again by different competitors, for I am the last of the line of
      Begsurbeck, and of all the blood-royals; and indeed who is so proper to
      maintain it flourishing as he who has brought it to the present
      perfection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great sir," says I, "my ambition rises no higher than to abound in good
      deeds whilst I live, and to perfect my children in the same principle; and
      this, I hope, will entitle them to a support when I am gone. But," says I,
      "why is your majesty so averse from marriage, merely on account of a woman
      you could not expect to be true to you?"&mdash;"Not expect it!" says he;
      "what stronger tie upon earth could she have had to be true than my
      affection, and all that my kingdom could afford her?"&mdash;"Weak things
      all, sir," says I.&mdash;"Why, what could she have had?" said he, in some
      warmth.&mdash;"Honour, sir," says I, "and virtue, both which she abandoned
      to become yours; and those once lost, how could you expect her to be
      true?"&mdash;"You are too hard for me, father," says he; "but they are all
      alike, and I don't believe there's a grain of honour in any of them."&mdash;"In
      any of them like Yaccombourse, I admit, sir," says I; "but think not so of
      others, for no part of our species abounds more with it, or is more tender
      of it, than a good woman; and take my word for it, sir, there is more real
      sincerity in an ordinary wife than in the most extraordinary mistress. We
      are all biassed naturally by interest, and as there can be but one real
      interest between the man and wife, so the interest of a mistress is, and
      ever will be, to accommodate herself; for 'tis all one to her with whom
      she engages, so she can raise but the market by a change. Now if your
      majesty could find an agreeable and virtuous wife, one deserving of your
      royal person and bed, and perhaps with a kingdom for her dowry, a partner
      fit to share your cares as well as glory, would it not be a great pleasure
      to you to be possessed of' such a mate, and to see heirs arising under
      your joint tuition, to convey down your royal blood to the latest
      posterity? Would not this, I say, be a grateful reflection to you in your
      declining years?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, father," says the king, "as you have painted it, the prospect
      could not fail to please, and under the circumstances you have put it, it
      would meet my approbation; but where is such a thing as a woman of this
      character to be found? I fear only in the imagination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," says I, after a seeming muse for some time, "what should you think
      of Oniwheske, the king of Norbon's daughter? he has but that one child, I
      hear."&mdash;"Dear father, have done," says his majesty; "to what purpose
      should you mention her? We but barely know that there is such a State, we
      have never had any intercourse; and, besides, as you say he has but one
      child, can you suppose she will ever marry, to leave so fine a kingdom,
      and live here?"&mdash;"But, sir," says I, "now we are supposing, suppose
      she should, with her father's consent, be willing to marry you, would you
      have her for your queen?"&mdash;"To make any doubt of that, father," says
      he, "is almost to suppose me a fool."&mdash;"Then, sir," says I, "her
      father has consented, and she too; and if I durst have presumed so far, or
      had known your mind sooner, she would I believe have ventured with me to
      have become yours, but you might have slighted her, and crowned heads are
      not to be trifled with; but since you are pleased to show your approbation
      of it, I can assure you, sir, her person will yield to none in your
      majesty's dominions; for, sir, I have been there, and have seen her, and
      she is your own, and her kingdom too, upon demand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," says the king, looking earnestly at me, "I have been frequently,
      since I knew you first, in doubt of my own existence. My life seems a
      dream to me; for if existence is to be judged of by one's faculties only,
      I have been in such a delusion of them ever since, that as I find myself
      unable to judge with certainty of any other thing, so I am subject to
      doubt whether I really exist. Are these things possible that you tell me,
      father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I then told him the whole affair, and advised him by all means to accept
      the offer, and marry the princess out of hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty, when I had brought him thoroughly to believe me, was as eager
      to consummate the marriage, as I was to have him; but then, whether he
      should go to her, or she come to him, was the question. I told him it was
      a thing unusual for a sovereign to quit his own dominions for a wife; but
      would advise an embassy to her father, with notice that his majesty would
      meet and espouse her on the frontiers of the two kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ambassadors returning with an appointment of time and place, it was
      not above a month before I had settled Stygee on the thrones of Sass
      Doorpt Swangeanti and Mount Alkoe, with the reversion of the kingdom of
      Norbon, without a competitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall here give you an account of the marriage ceremony. The king being
      arrived on the borders, Stygee, who had waited but a few hours at the last
      village in Norbon, advanced to his majesty on the very division, as they
      called it, of the two kingdoms, a line being drawn to express the bounds
      of each. The king and Stygee having talked apart from the company a little
      space, each standing hand in hand, on their own respective ground, the
      chief ragan advanced, and began the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      He first asked each party aloud, if he and she were willing to be united
      in body and affections, and would engage to continue so their whole lives
      to which each party having answered aloud in the affirmative, "Show me
      then a token!" says he; and immediately each expanding the right side of
      their graundees, laid it upon the other's left side, so that they appeared
      then but as one body, standing hand in hand, encased round with the
      graundee. The ragan then having descanted upon the duties of marriage,
      concluded the ceremony with wishing them as fruitful as Perigen and
      Philella. So soon as it was over, and the gripsacks and voices had
      finished an epithalamium, the bride and bridegroom taking wing, were
      conducted to Brandleguarp, amidst the acclamations of an infinite number
      of Georigetti's subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king had made vast preparations for the reception of the princess
      Stygee; and nothing was to be heard or seen but feastings and rejoicing
      for many days; and his majesty afterwards assured me of his entire
      satisfaction in my choice of his bride, without whom he confessed, that
      notwithstanding the many other blessings I had procured him, his happiness
      must have been incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intending another flight to Norbon, I was charged with the king and
      queen's compliments to Oniwheske; which having executed, I opened a free
      trade to Mount Alkoe; and hearing that small vessels came frequently on
      the Norbonese coast, to carry off the iron and other metal from thence
      unwrought, and paid part of their return in wrought metals, I ordered some
      of the next that came to be stopped and brought to me; and the day before
      I had fixed for my departure, notice was sent that twelve of those traders
      were stopped, and in custody at the sea-side. I longed to see them, but
      then considering that it would take up more time to bring them to Apsilo
      the capital, where I was, than I should take in going to them and
      returning, I resolved to go and examine them myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They told me they traded with small vessels to Norbon for metals, which
      they carried home, and wrought great part of it themselves, sending it to
      and dispersing it in several islands at a distance; and also sold the
      unwrought to several people who carried it they knew not whither in great
      ships. They said they kept abundance of hands at work in the trade. I
      asked if their artificers wrought it for their own profit, or their
      masters'. They told me for masters, themselves being all slaves.&mdash;"And
      are you all slaves?" says I.&mdash;They told me "Yes, all but one,"
      pointing to him. I then ordered him to be secured and removed; and told
      them if they would procure some hands to settle at Norbon and Mount Alkoe,
      they should all be made free, have lands assigned them, and have other
      privileges, and I did not doubt in time would become the richest men in
      the country; for I understood by them they were acquainted with the use of
      money. I asked them what other commodities they brought to Norbon in
      exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said clothes for the people, both what they received in exchange from
      others who bought their iron, and some of a coarser sort of their own
      making. I found in my discourse I had with them, that out of my eleven men
      there were persons of four different occupations; so I promised those who
      would stay with me their freedoms, good houses, and other rewards: and
      sending three hands home with the vessel, and a full freight, according to
      the value of the cargo they brought, I ordered them to engage as many as
      they could of their countrymen of distinct trades, to come and settle with
      me; and to be sure, if they had any grain, corn, roots, plants, or seeds,
      usually eaten for food, to bring all they could get with them, and they
      should have good returns for them; and as to those good hands that settled
      here, they should be allowed all materials to work for their own profit
      the first year, and after that they should also work for themselves,
      allowing the king one-tenth of the clear profit. This took so far with
      them, that it was with the utmost difficulty I got any of them to carry
      the ship back, for fear they should not be able to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I parted from them, I assigned the eight who were left all proper
      conveniences, and recommended them to the king's protection; and I ordered
      the owner, then in custody, to be conducted to Mount Alkoe, and from
      thence to Brandleguarp; where, treating him kindly and giving him liberty,
      I made my proper use of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king having lent me a convoy to conduct my prisoner, and given me a
      license for as many cattle of the sorts I chose as I pleased to drive to
      Georigetti's dominions, I made them drive a great number of sheep of the
      finest wool I ever saw, and very large also; a great number of creatures
      not unlike an ass for shape, but with two upright horns and short ears,
      which gave abundance of rich milk; and also some swine. All these were
      drove to, and distributed at my new colony, where I let them remain till I
      had provided a proper receptacle for them at Doorpt Swangeanti, near the
      woods; when I brought many over the Black Mountain, and distributed there,
      with directions how to manage them; and in about seven years' time we held
      a little beast-market near Brandle-guarp twice a year, where the spare
      cattle were brought up, and preserved in salt till the next market; for I
      had some years before made large salt-works near the sea at Mount Alkoe,
      which employed abundance of hands, and was now become a considerable
      trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had iron, copper, and silver money, which went very current; and had
      butter and cheese from the farms near the woods, as plenty as we had the
      fruits before, great numbers of families having settled there; and there
      was scarce a family but was of some occupation or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the accounts I received from the mines, from time to time, it was
      prodigious to hear what vast quantities of metals were prepared in one
      year now, by little above one-third of the hands that were usually
      employed in them before; for now the men's ambition was to leave a good
      week's work done at their return, for an example to those who were coming;
      and the overseers told me they would sing and work with the greatest
      delight imaginable, whilst they pleased themselves with telling one
      another how they intended to spend the next fourteen days.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LL things being
      now so settled that they would go on of themselves, and having no further
      direct view in my head, I spent my time with my wife; and looking over my
      books one day to divert myself, with the greatest joy imaginable I found
      that the Bible I had taken to be in the Portuguese tongue was a Latin one.
      It was many years since I had thought of that language; but on this
      occasion, by force of memory and recollection, and with some attention,
      consideration, and practice, I found it return to me in so plentiful a
      manner that I fully resolved to translate my Bible into the Swangeantine
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sent directly for Lasmeel to be my amanuensis, and to work we went upon
      the translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We began at the creation, and descending to the flood, went on to the
      Jewish captivity in Egypt and deliverance by Moses, leaving out the
      genealogies and all the Jewish ceremonies and laws, except the Ten
      Commandments. I translated the books of Samuel and Kings, down to the
      Babylonish captivity. I then translated such parts of the Prophets as were
      necessary to introduce the Messiah, and discover Him; the books of Psalms,
      Job, and the Proverbs, and with the utmost impatience hasted to the New
      Testament. But then considering that when I had done, as only Lasmeel and
      myself could read it, in case of our deaths, the translation must die with
      us, I chose out six of the junior ragans, and two of the elder, to learn
      letters; and in less than twelve months I had brought them all to read
      mine and Lasmeel's writings perfectly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I instructed these ragans at spare hours, whilst I went on with my
      translation; but finding my paper grow low, having had a great supply of
      coarse linen, and a sort of calicoes from the isles, in return for our
      metals, I set up a manufactory from that, and some gums of the trees,
      which we boiled with it to a pulp in iron pans, and beating it to pieces,
      made a useful paper which would bear ink tolerably. But I could find
      nothing to make ink of, though I sent over all the country to search for
      every herb and fruit not commonly used; till at last I found an herb and
      flower on it, which, if taken before the flower faded, would, by boiling
      thoroughly, become blue; this, by still more boiling in a copper pan till
      it was dry and burnt hard to the bottom, in some measure answered my
      purpose, and I fixed upon it as the best I could obtain from all my
      experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ragans were masters of their pens, I set six of them to copy what
      Lasmeel had finished, and the other two to teach their brethren; and in
      two years' time, by a pretty constant application (for I made them
      transcribe it perfectly fair and intelligible), we finished our
      translation, and two fair copies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then ordered the ragans to read a portion of it to the people
      constantly, in the mouch; they, from the novelty of the story, at first
      grew so exceeding fond of it, that upon the proper expositions of it I
      taught the ragans afterwards to make, they began to apply it seriously to
      religious purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      My writing ragans were very fond of their knowledge of letters; and trade
      and commerce now increasing, which put every one more or less in want of
      the same knowledge, they made a great profit of it, by instructing all who
      applied to them. This increase of writing necessarily provided a
      maintenance for several persons who travelled to Norbon for quills, and
      sold them to the Swangeantines at extravagant rates; till the Norbonese
      hearing that, brought them themselves to the foot of the mountain, where
      the Swangeantines bought them, as they did several other commodities which
      one country had and the other wanted, especially iron wares of almost
      every denomination: so that the mountain, being so excessively high, was
      the barrier; for the Norbonese finding that difficulty in ascending and
      descending which the Swangeantines with their graundees did not, there was
      a constant market of buyers and sellers on the Mount Alkoe side of the
      Black Mountain, which by degrees grew the general mart of the three
      kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have often reflected with myself, and have been amazed to think, that so
      ingenious and industrious a people as the Swangeantines have since
      appeared to be, and who, till I came amongst them, had nothing more than
      bare food, and a hole to lie in, in a barren rocky country, and then
      seemed to desire only what they had, should in ten years' time be supplied
      not only with the conveniences, but superfluities of life; and that they
      should then become so fond of them, as rather willingly to part with life
      itself than be reduced to the state I found them in. And I have as often,
      on this occasion, reflected on the goodness of Providence, in rendering
      one part of mankind easy under the absence of such comforts as others
      could not rest without; and have made it a great argument for my assent to
      well-attested truths above my comprehension. "For," says I, "to have
      affirmed, at my first coming, either that these things could have been
      made at all, or when done could have been of any additional benefit to
      these people, would have been so far beyond their imaginations, that the
      reporter of so plain a truth, as they now find it, would have been looked
      upon as a madman or an impostor; but by opening their views by little and
      little, and showing them the dependence of one thing upon another, he that
      should now affirm the inutility of them, would be observed in a much worse
      light." And yet, without any embellishments of art, how did this so great
      a people live under the protection of Providence? Let us first view them
      at a vast distance from any sort of sustenance, yet from the help of the
      graundee that distance was but a step to them. They were forced to inhabit
      the rocks, from an utter incapacity of providing shelter elsewhere, having
      no tool that would either cut down timber for a habitation, or dig up the
      earth for a fence, or materials to make one; but they had a liquor that
      would dissolve the rock itself into habitations. They had neither beast
      nor fish, for food or burthen; but they had fruits equivalent to both, of
      the same relish, and as wholesome, without shedding blood. Their fruits
      were dangerous till they had fermented in a boiling heat; and they had
      neither the sun, nor any fire, nor the knowledge how to propagate or
      continue it. But they had their hot springs always boiling, without their
      care or concern. They had neither the skins of beasts, the original
      clothing, nor any other artificial covering from the weather; but they
      were born with that warm clothing the graundee, which being of a
      considerable density, and full of veins flowing with warm blood, not only
      defended their flesh from all outward injuries, but was a most soft,
      comely, and warm dress to the body. They lived mostly in the dark rock,
      having less difference of light with the change of seasons than other
      people have; but either by custom or make, more light than what Providence
      has sent them in the sweecoe is disagreeable: so that where little is to
      be obtained, Providence, by confining the capacity, can give content with
      that; and where apparent wants are, we may see, by these people, how
      careful Providence is to supply them; for neither the graundee, the
      sweecoes, nor their springs, are to be found where those necessaries can
      be supplied by other means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst my other considerations, I have often thought that if I had gone
      to the top of the Black Mountains northward of Brandleguarp, in the very
      lightest time, I might have seen the sun; but these mountains were so
      elevated, that our lightest time was only the gilded glimmering of their
      tops, having never seen so much light on them as totally to eclipse all
      the stars, of which we had always the same in view, but in different
      positions.

      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Peter's children provided for&mdash;Youwarkee's death&mdash;How the
      king and queen spent their time&mdash;Peter grows melancholy&mdash;Wants
      to get to England&mdash;Contrives means&mdash;Is taken up at sea.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> HAD now been at
      Brandleguarp ten years, and my children were all provided for by the king
      but Dickey, as fast as they were qualified for employment, and such as
      were fit for it were married off to the best alliances in the country; so
      that I had only to sit down and see everything I had put my hand to
      prosper, and not an evil eye in the three kingdoms cast at me: but about
      my eleventh or twelfth year, my wife falling into a lingering disorder, at
      the end of two years it carried her off. This was the first real
      affliction I had suffered for many years, and so soured my temper, that I
      became fit for nothing, and it was painful to me even to think of
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king's marriage had produced four children, three sons and a daughter,
      which he would frequently tell me were mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oniwheske was dead, and the king and queen divided their whole time
      equally between Brandleguarp and Apsillo; but he was building a palace at
      my new colony, which by this time was grown to a vast city, and was called
      Stygena, in compliment to the queen; and this new palace was designed to
      receive the court one-third of the year, as it lay almost at equal
      distance between both his other palaces. This method, which his majesty
      took, at my persuasion, on the death of Oniwheske, though it went against
      the grain at first, was now grown so habitual to him, and he saw his own
      interest so much in it in the love and esteem it procured him from the
      people, that at last he wanted no spur to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My melancholy for the death of my wife, which I hoped time would wear off,
      rather gained ground upon me; and though I was as much regarded as ever by
      the whole court, yet it grew troublesome to me even to be asked my advice;
      and it not only surprised those about me, but even myself, to see the same
      genius, without any visible natural decay, in so short a time, from the
      most sprightly and enterprising, become the most phlegmatic and inactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      My longings after my native country, ever since my wife's death, redoubled
      upon me, and I had formed several schemes of getting thither; as first, I
      had formed a project of going off by the islands, as I had so many small
      vessels at command there, and to get into the main ocean and try my
      fortune that way; but upon inquiry I found that my vessels could not get
      to sea, or elsewhere, but to the zaps' islands, by reason of the many
      rocks and sandbanks which would oppose me, unless I went through the zaps'
      country, which, in the light they had reason to view me, I was afraid to
      do. Then I had thoughts of going from the coast of Norbon; but that must
      have been in one of the foreign vessels, and they coming from a quite
      different quarter than I must go, in all probability if I had put to sea
      any way they were unacquainted with, they having no compass, we must have
      perished; for the more I grew by degrees acquainted with the situation of
      Doorpt Swangeanti, the stronger were my conjectures that my nearest
      continent must be the southern coast of America; but still it was only
      conjecture. At length, being tired and uneasy, I resolved, as I was
      accustomed to flight, and loved it, I would take a turn for some days;
      carry me where it would, I should certainly light on some land, whence at
      first I could but come back again. I then went to see if my chair, board,
      and ropes, were sound, for I had not used them for several years past; but
      I found them all so crazy, I durst not venture in them, which
      disappointment put off my journey for some time. However, as I had still
      the thought remaining, it put me on seeking some other method to put it in
      practice; so I contrived the poles from which you took me, being a sort of
      hollow cane the Swangeantines make their spears of, but exceeding strong
      and springy, which, interwoven with small cords, were my seat, and were
      much lighter than my chair; and these buoyed me up when your goodness
      relieved me. I had taken Mount Alkoe bearers, as I knew I must come to a
      country of more light; and I now find, if I had not fallen, I must soon
      have reached land, if we could have held out, for we were come too far to
      think of returning, without a resting-place: and what will become of my
      poor bearers, I dread to think; if they attempted to return, they must
      have dropt, for they had complained all the last day and night, and had
      shifted very often. If in your history you think fit to carry down the
      life of a poor old man any farther, you will as well know what to say of
      me as I can tell you; and I hope what I have hitherto said will in some
      measure recompense both your expense and labour.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
